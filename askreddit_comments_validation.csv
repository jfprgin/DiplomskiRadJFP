f08dxb,fgs7erl,"They'd be fine.

The problem with poverty is not usually day-to-day costs. People can adjust to that.  It's unexpected expenses that are crippling.

~~*Edit: Why are people still responding two weeks later! Nobody is reading this thread any more! At least not the responses at the bottom*~~ (Edit2: rant was too whiney. If you have something to say, who am I to say otherwise?)",12352
f08dxb,fgs4uvj,I doubt a month is enough to really feel the effect,8281
f08dxb,fgs5ek3,"It would be incredibly self-serving and boring. They would never truly experience what it is like to be in the precarious position of a minimum wage employee living hand-to-mouth and the 'novelty' is just salt in the wound.

If it's too fake, with too many ""emotional"" moments, advertising and people shouting, I'm out.",25124
f08dxb,fgs75do,"It’s more than just the money. It’s the lack of security these people endure. Not knowing if you’ll lose your job tomorrow and having no savings. Being kicked out of your home. An unexpected bill you can’t afford, which may lead to increasing debt. 

Putting these rich people in a “poor” lifestyle for a month isn’t enough. Even if they lost their money and homes, they’ll have such a huge network that they’ll be back on their feet in the time it takes for us peons to earn enough to eat for a week. They can never truly understand what it’s like to be poor or ever face that reality again. 

So what would happen? It’d be a completely self-serving advert about how “now I realise that we need to do more for our employees.” The workers get a small vanity bonus, probably give an immigrant worker with limited English a car, pat themselves on the back. Then two weeks later, we’ve all forgotten about the show and they’ll go back to their old ways.",12790
f08dxb,fgs608x,Isn’t this almost the same as secret millionaire? Do you guys have that in the US?,741
f08dxb,fgs5fcp,"Lots of rich people voluntarily go on vacation to third world countries. The catch is, they know they have a way out and an end date. 

I'd be interested to watch a show where the CEO had to personally be financially responsible for the welfare of 50% of their lowest payed employees for 10 years, and their net growth percentage equalled their bonus every year, with a big bonus if both the company and the employees were profitable at the end.",1653
f08dxb,fgs3caw,"Sure. They would never do that though, because then they would have to admit that they don't pay a living wage.",4457
f08dxb,fgs7jst,1 month isn't long enough because no rent is due etc.,166
f08dxb,fgsafyc,"You should watch Undercover Billionaire on Discovery (not to be confused with Undercover Boss). Billionaire Glenn Stearns moves to Erie PA with just $100, a truck and no contacts and has to make a company valued at $1 million in 90 days. He also can't mention who he is to anyone. It's pretty much exactly like you are describing and insanely entertaining.",76
f08dxb,fgsp76o,"No. 

Slumming is not living your entire life in a slum.  

Here is what will happen: 

- Fake billionaires like Trump will come to this show. Real billionaires will probably not. 

- those who appear on this show will brag about how they are self made and their employees could make do with even less. 


- We will find out, like Naked and Afraid, that outside of cameras these billionaires were living in their luxury RVs , sipping martinis and having affairs.",57
f08dxb,fgs5kaf,There was an episode of American Dad where they tried to live on minimum wage for a month- it was FANTASTIC.,135
f08dxb,fgs5qfd,"They would just treat it as a novelty since they know they will be getting their billions back at the end of the month. They wouldn't have to truly live like a person does who lives hand to mouth every day of their lives. They wouldn't really learn anything from it, in fact they would probably look back on it and laugh, ""Oh remember when we had to eat that can of ravioli hahaha!""",183
f08dxb,fgs5t1l,"They would have to swap everything down to the last detail. Apartment, car (if they even have one), wardrobe, food, hobbies, etc. And it would have to be on going, not just a couple months.

draola,f6hcvrp,"This is not a good idea.  Think about it: someone could game the system and self-cross-post their own work to garner more publicity.

himsju,fwhudk9,"I was working as a stockboy in a supermarket and when we had to fill the milk cooler people would bust open a 12 pack of milk cartons and put them in one by one. 

On my first day I just placed the 12 pack in the cooler and cut the plastic off on one side with my box cutter and yanked it from under it and the look of the store manager and the other employee who was training me was pure bewilderment.

From that day everyone did it my way.",8391
himsju,fwhx9nr,"Worked as a laborer at a nursery one summer. Daily tasks included manually watering 15,000 plants each day. Put together a back of the napkin plan to build an irrigation system and spent the next few weeks building it with some money from the boss. That system is still running 15 years later and does all the work now. I did automate myself out of the job and had to find another eventually. 

Couple years later got my engineering degree. I’m convinced Engineers are inherently lazy people that will spend a disproportionate effort to make things easier.",5045
himsju,fwh9mec,"I had a math teacher that actively encouraged his students to be as lazy as possible, defining lazy as actively searching for ways to do as minimal work as possible.

himsju,fwhmqbe,"I was once set to test a certain piece of equipment on a ship. The test involved attaching the unit to a reader, then run loads of command line commands. Then, one would have to make a copy of all the text, copy it into word and save it as a (real crappy looking) report. There was HUNDREDS of units, and they needed to be testet several times a year. We did about 20-30 a day. It would take several weeks to finish. 

I didn't know coding at the time, but always wanted to learn it.

Within two months, I had made a program, even with a GUI (to spot faults with ease, instead of having to actually READ the reports). The program could read three units at a time, and would automatically create a smooth pdf report and save it on our server, named with serial number and date.

The job was now to attach three units, then wait for about 3 minutes, detach and attach new ones. Basically 30 seconds work, 3 minutes break. I could now test all units in a day, though I would typically spread it out over a couple more days.

When I left the company, I left the program on the test computer. I got an email from an ex colleague a few months later, saying they were using the program on several ships now. There wasn't any manual for the program, of course, but it was so straight forward that it wasn't needed.",534

aicgpz,eemq0zv,"Functionally - you would need an amendment rather than just a law.

Congressional members aren't paid from annual appropriations and are paid through a salary not based on hours worked, but as their status as members. More importantly, members of Congress are constitutional officers. The President (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution. As such, they're all constitutionally entitled to pay.

Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution:

>The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

27th Amendment:

>No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.

It also functionally wouldn't do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (AOC for example). The shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that *need* that money imminently, which is not the vast majority of Congress and certainly not the President. So that amendment would functionally not be much more than a feel-good effort.",552
aicgpz,eems7gk,"This simple argument against it is that newer or less corrupt congressmen would be the only ones to suffer. If you're making 500K selling your soul to a big corporation, than your check for being a part of congress is an after thought. Mean while freshmen senators who realistically spent nearly all of their money on campaigning to get into congress and change a broken system will be the only ones to suffer. 

So this could just help the spread of corruption against high ranking government members. Although why should they be exempt from suffering the way TSA workers or Prison workers do?

I feel that instead of stopping anyone from getting payed, if a budget isn't agreed upon, than we have an emergency 3 months airbag where we pay federal workers for those 3 months and essentially use the previous budget. If those 3 months go by and still no movement is made, then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency. Something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president. This later one is dangerous because there are times that congress would be willing to kill it's self to kick a sitting president out of power, such as republicans during the Obama administration, and I suspect Democrats during the Trump administration.

Additionally congress should be forced into a minimum of 8 hour work days with the president sitting in on the meeting trying to find a compromise. There should be no vacations, time off, or excuses with the exception of terminal illness. If a member of congress fails to show up, they would effectively be removed from congress, and if the sitting President or Vice President is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget.",331
aicgpz,eemppwf,"I like the idea, but I don't think it would do a whole lot. First, there would be some Constitutional issues with regards to the 27th Amendment. I think you could phrase it so that you can comply with the 27th Amendment, but there would certainly be court challenges that you would have to spend time and energy fighting.

Beyond that, though, Senators, Representatives, and Presidents aren't really dependent on their salaries. The majority of them are either independently wealthy or make a ton of money off capital gains (ie investments). I don't think holding their salary would change their standard of living in the slightest.",58

Michael Douglas' character knew about the organization and how Sean Penn's character talked about the experience. Also, it's in the woods.

I remember her talking about her diagnosis. She was a breast cancer surgeon herself, you couldn’t make it up. She walked into the room, saw her own scans with the doctor and her heart dropped, she barely heard a word he said because she couldn’t stop the flood of information she was getting. Looking at the scan she knew if she’d need surgery, chemo, radiotherapy, how long it would be, what her estimated survival was.

I don’t think they discussed it like a group project, but I suppose she couldn’t stop herself from listening to her own internal monologue since it was her own field.

Later, she reminded him that he didn't have to participate in the decision making and that he could just let her be the doctor and focus on himself. He ended up taking her up on this offer. So even between the same patient and doctor, the relationship varied.",4118
jx6m5s,gcupxd5,"I'm an ER doctor, and sometimes I have other doctors as patients.

For the most part they're pretty good patients because they can give a good description of their symptoms in a way that's useful the me.  They usually ask good questions and are well equipped to have an informed discussion about their diagnosis and treatment.  Sometimes it's hard for me to dial back my ""patient talk"" where I simplify medical terms for laypeople.  Sometimes it's challenging if their area of expertise is totally unrelated to the issue at hand and they don't recognize their limited understanding.

The worst patients are those who have just a little medical knowledge and think they know everything.  Some version of: ""My aunt is a nurse, and she said a need a whole body MRI for this runny nose...""

I don’t come in for trivial things like self-limiting infections or things that are harmless because I know that they are. But I do go see my regular doctor for problems that really bother me or for routine exams like anyone else.

It can be weirdly stressful to be the doctor or the patient in this kind of interaction. I’ve learned to not let it bother me when I am the doctor seeing other doctors. It can be harmful to the doctor as a patient, if you let that kind of interaction get to you. I try not to generate stress for other doctors who see me and know what I am.

Three weeks of education, planning, and worse of all convincing this kid and mother that their IQ wouldn’t drop because they had agreed to irradiate the parasites!!!

js8e1z,gby1j41,"Once had a patient whose wife shook their baby to death.  He wanted help reconnecting with his wife. 

At the time I was a young father of a newborn myself, and he triggered a lot of fear in me for my own child, a deep loathing of his spouse, and pity (the ""how pathetic"" kind) for the patient. 

I tried for 3 sessions, met his spouse and everything before handing the case over to my supervisor (who knew about my initial reactions, and tried to help me through it).

Unfortunately, it ended up being more about my feelings than his, and I was new to the profession at the time. These things are expected to crop up from time to time, but I was still taken aback by my own reactions.",7232

But I have very directly made my thoughts clear about choices, especially choices parents make for/about their kids. This probably comes off as judgement depending on the clients insecurity about the topic. 

One example was telling parents of a child I was working with with a severe mood disorder (that had made both suicidal and homicidal threats and attempts) that it did not seem like a good idea to buy the young kid a gun, especially the week after the mother spent the session sharing her fears that the child would murder her.",203

I dragged us through every day.

jb1el5,g8t6b19,"Welp I'm a Greek woman and I'm doing my masters in history, and have done a paper on the music about the fall of Constantinople. In summary, the fall of Constantinople was kind of inevitable. The empire was in its last legs, due in large part to the the fall during the fourth crusade in 1204. It had a lot of internal and external problems. For example, Konstantinos Palaiologos was never officially coronated, due to religious infighting. The Ottoman empire had already conquered all of the farmland around, and was right to go for the kill at the time that it did. It conquered a great strategic and cultural landmark. The Hagia Sophia had already become a mosque in 29th May 1453, 2.30 in the afternoon. It's a pity for my heritage, but at that time I think it was inevitable.

Edit: wtf guys thanks!! O.O
Edit no. 2: Actually no, guys, the paper wasn't on There might be giants! It was on Greek folk laments on the event of the fall, and how accurate were their lyrics in relation to the actual event.

In reality there was not much holding the remnants of the Byzantine Empire alive once the farmland in Anatolia had been conquered realistically the city would only be able to survive for so long. In addition the Ottomans raising taxes on trade would block off connections to China and India which would help to encourage the Spaniards and Portuguese as well as the Dutch later on in their maritime shipping interests.

I don't think the problem is that men do not talk about their feelings. I think the problem is that they often don't have someone to talk to. 
In addition, it can be quite hard to make new friends. Especially when you are past your twenties. You know, people you are potentially interested in are married and have kids. They are preoccupied with their own lives. 

I felt very lonely and sad after my last long term relationship ended. It took me over 6 months to find new friends and I'm a hardcore extrovert. Still, I made a bunch of new friends within the past year or so.

chm4um,euv2kmi,"I had this feeling for all my life after puberty.


There were these high ideals that I always maintained and couldn't live up to them. Mostly because they were about saving the world and unattainable things like that. I spent an absurd amount of my teenage years studying philosophy and religion rather than dealing with teenage social issues like my peers. Ever since I was a kid, I had this goofy side though. When I wasn't pulling my hair out reading about semiotics, I would write silly stories to make people laugh.

When I went to college, things changed. I began exhibiting some really dangerous behavior patterns, especially for someone with a huge conscience like myself. The line between my public and private life got larger. I began feeling I could no wrong. I don't really want to list some of the things I did here because of shame. But suffice it to say, you would have all hated college me.

I'm going to skip to the end and just say this all got worse until I woke up one day and all my lightheartedness was gone. I was working a high paying meaningless job. I'd cheated on everyone I dated and thrown away every romantic relationship, some very painfully.

My life had become all about money, sex, and status.

The biggest epiphany of my life was realizing two things.

One, everyone goes through some form of this. We all try on different faces. If we find one that doesn't fit, we still tend to cling to it so that we don't have to change our current comfort level. This phase is normal and human.


Two, I was bipolar. Manic. My post puberty life was punctuated by periods of unbelievable energy and increasingly risky behavior. It put me on top - there were years where I had fans. I got up on stage and gave speeches and made people laugh and was the center of attention. And later it landed me in jail because the center cannot hold.

But with that diagnosis I finally was able to figure out my history and why I could never live up to those ideals. Because grandiosity is a textbook manic symptom too.

These days I don't push myself to do any more than love my family and enjoy the little things. I've lived more than most people do in a lifetime. I deserve a rest, at least for a little while.

Sorry this is so long.


The answer is that the normal cycle is to lose yourself for a little while and then find yourself again. Everyone has an existential crisis to some degree. You have to trust that this is normal and your real self is always there waiting for your return.

How you return, that will be unique. A death in the family, jail, overdose, failed relationship, financial loss, you name it. Something has to touch you deeply and it will happen. In the natural course of things we all take a big hit sooner or later.


I don't like to generalize but the 20s are a time when people tend to drift away from themselves. After that it's really anyone's guess when you'll come back.

But since you're asking this question, I say it will be sooner than later for you.",1163

I didn't even realize how little I knew who I was until a friend asked about what my life was like before college, and I couldn't come up with just one answer. Instead of being my full self wherever I went, I adapted to the culture I was immersed in, and then got ready to change again once we moved to the next place.

Our social environment has this power just because we do not exist apart from a society. Society is our extended mind and body.

However normal these thoughts are (over 90% of the population), the moral nature of these thoughts mean that often people experience a lot of shame and take many years before they first tell someone about them.

Edit. Because this is getting more visibility that I realised : The occurrence of these thoughts/images/urges are normal. The best way to “manage” them is to accept that they are a normal (albeit unpleasant) brain process, and a sign of the opposite of who you are and are therefore v.v.unlikely to ever do. Let the thought run its course in the background while you bring your attention back to (insert something you can see/feel/hear/taste/touch). I usually say something like “ok mind! Thanks for that mind! I’m going to get back to washing the dishes and the sound/sensation of the water while you ponder all the nasties.

hmwgz4,fx8fcj0,"Willingness to forgive you when you make a mistake/speak in anger/etc rather than hold a grudge or try to punish you. (Doesn’t mean they won’t be still be upset of course.)

Willingness to admit fault and take responsibility when they make a mistake/speak in anger/etc and work on their own negative behaviors. Related: taking you seriously when something upsets you even if it doesn’t seem like a big deal from their perspective.

Not losing their temper when things don’t go their way. Example: do you want to be with someone who blows up when the car breaks down on a road trip and makes everyone else miserable or the person who calmly calls the repair service and tries to make the best of it?

Not making personal attacks during arguments. Focusing more on how they are feeling and fixing the problem at hand, and then reconciling afterward, rather than lashing out with a list of perceived character flaws. Example: “I feel disrespected when...” rather than “You’re such a disrespectful [expletive of choice]!”

Genuine care for you and others; a lack of self-centeredness. Being open to hear the perspectives of others, even when they don’t agree. An understanding that they are not the center of the universe, they are not always right, and there is always something to learn.

In short: emotional maturity.",745

Q: My friend is in an abusive relationship, but she won't allow us to help her leave it. How do we safely get her out?

A: You don't. You need to offer her the opposite of what her abuser is: choices. Allow her to socialize with whom she wishes, even her abuser because he's probably isolating her.

A few minutes later an officer comes knocking on the doors of the offices and yelling for everyone to run outside because a fire had broken out. Some of the teens had set mattresses on fire in their cells.

I didn't really nope out. My teacher did (she hadn't even been there that day). So i was forced by the university to choose another place to intern at. Oh well.",1175
n9jyqk,gxowy10,On the first day of working at Amazon warehouse the managers broke down to Everyone how a 15 minute break works there. Walking to the break room is 2 1/2 minutes. 10 minutes of actual break and then 2 1/2 minutes to go back to your stations. It took me 2 1/2 minutes to walk to my car and I took a forever break.,5450
n9jyqk,gxon83h,Answered an ad in the paper (this was the mid 90s) what seemed to be an office job making sales calls when I was in college. Did a phone interview and was called back for an in person interview. When I go to the interview I'm led into a room with about 50 other people and a small stage at the front of the room. We're all somewhat confused as to what is going on. Finally a guy gets on the stage and informs us that we've been selected for the opportunity to sell Cutco. Me and 2/3rds of the rest stood up and walked out.,3299

n9jyqk,gxonrk9,"My first ever job.

I was thirteen and I would be delivering phone books from the back of a van through peoples letterboxes.

So I'd be in the back of the van with the phone books and there was an older guy driving slowly while I went back and forth to the van/houses with the books.

At one point the van was getting quite empty so there was more space to move around and we had finished the delivery in the street we were paid to deliver to and he drove to another.

While driving there he drove lets say aggressively and I fell inside the back where the books were. I wasn't sitting in a seat as the van had no seats in the back. As I put my hand out to steady myself I accidentally laid it across a portable radio that had its antenna extended but the antenna was also broken half-way and razer sharp.

It sliced the palm of my hand clean open 3-4 inches. I can only describe what I saw as gruesome. I said to him to pull the van over and I needed help. He saw my hand and just threw me a plastic bag, the kind you'd get at a supermarket and told me to wrap my hand in it.

Then .. he continued with the deliveries, at-least he delivered the remaining books himself.

I should have been taken to a hospital or at-least home to my parents. I quit after that and never showed up again. As you can imagine my parents were quite angry at him.",564
n9jyqk,gxomuok,"Restaurant line chef. Worked a 12 hour shift, was given 2 breaks of about 10-15 min each. Burned my hand numerous times because they gave me plates that came right from the oven and never said a word. End of the shift I told the head chef I was done. He called me soft and Said I was the third person to quit on him after a day. I said “maybe it’s the way you treat people”.",1405
n9jyqk,gxoomv6,"Two times. 

Once I applied for and got a telemarketing job. I didn’t know what it entailed. After an hour I knew it was a terrible fit...auto dialing people during their dinners, trying to sell them stuff they didn’t want, reading a horrible script while sitting in a soulless grey cubicle. I got up, went to the manager, apologized and said it wasn’t a good fit for me. He seemed understanding. 

Another time I attended a “make easy money at this job” seminar and it turns out it was selling knives door to door. Idk if I technically “quit” or just noped out at the end of it.",462
n9jyqk,gxokbim,"I answered an ad for a baby sitting job. I was already working on a casual basis  but it was sporadic so I thought some after hours baby sitting would be welcome extra cash. 
The couple were both in the military and proceeded to tell me that I would be staying in the spare room and looking after their 6 mth old child around the clock as well as doing the housework.  I would have one day off every two weeks.  They said it is cash in hand so I could sign onto the dole (unemployment benifit) to make up the rest of the money. 
I left on the spot. They wanted a live in housemaid and nanny not a baby sitter and they were not able to pay for one. Why they thought it was up to me to illegally collect the dole to subsidise them I don't know.",16473
bhd99l,els1a6s,"I dreamt that I was part of some Eastern European resistance movement who had to speak in code and hide out in abandoned manors in the forest to plan our attacks against some fascist regime. We enlisted the pope to help us, but when we went to meet him he has double crossed us because the regime we were fighting somehow knew the pope was gay and was going to tell everyone. I woke up then, not knowing if my resistance group was executed, or if we escaped somehow.

This one girl on the cruise that we all universally hated (for reasons I can't remember) received a really random and useless mutation - she grew a really fat lizard tail, like a leopard gecko who has eaten a lot lol. She was crying about how ugly she was now and all we could do was laugh. Then I woke up.",2981
