A lot of us boomers built Revell models in the ancient past. The model business is tough and very competitive. There are still a bunch of businesses out there catering to that market. AMT-MPC, Tamiya, a lot of smaller companies continue to make their niche models. AMT is older than Revell. Most of AMT's molds disappeared long ago but some models have re-emerged. I know of at least one truck and several airplanes that AMT put out long ago that are back in production. Here is a tip. If you ever come across a model that you like and/or are interested in, buy it because if that model goes out of production you probably won't see it again. I know there are some molds from ancient past (1950s, 1960s) that are so old that the molds are hard if not impossible to use unless these molds are re-engineered. I know about model businesses because my Dad worked at a company back in the 1960s and 1970s that made model airplane kits. These models were also sold under the Lindberg and Hawk names. Ron Popiel ran the company. For awhile, the company was very successful then something happened in the late 1970s and things went south. The company was in Aurora, IL. All the molds that dad worked on were scrapped long ago. Dad told me that there was a building on Rt 25 in Aurora that had a couple of AMT molds in it, including a truck. I'd like to drive by and take a look at that. The Aurora story took place over 40 years so I'm fairly certain that the building is long gone. I don't remember the name of the company but I do know that in 2019 Polar Lights Models put out a model with the Aurora name on it. AMT models very briefly were put out with the Polar Lights name on them. AMT started up whenever AMT was  up to the point where the company that my dad worked for was going out of business. AMT's roots can be traced back to a kit company that went defunct in the 1980s. In the toon car model business, Monogram re-issued two kits that were supposed to have a couple of AMT logos on the side of the boxes. If you look at some very old AMT boxes you will see a red oval that contains the AMT logo as well as the word \"AMT\" written in a silver personalized script typeface. Both logos are hard to read if you are one of the people who needs reading glasses. In the 1980s when E.T. The Extra Terrestrial movie was released, AMT came out with a snap fit model of E.T. in his UFO. The model was cool looking but essentially a toy to get kids interested in buying the old-fashioned glue together models. There were two versions of the E.T. model, a 1/16th scale snap fit and a glue version where E.T. sat on a bicycle that he used in the movie. These models are no longer in production and are kinda hard to find. My wife and I rode by a place a number of years ago in Chicago Heights that looks like this building that has since been demolished was a model kit distribution center. The only way I can think of is the fact that the building was in a faded spray paint mural. A faded Aurora logo was painted on the building along with two other logos that said \"Lindberg\" and \"Hawk\". Model businesses are truly a rough business to be in. AMT, probably back in the early 1970s made FritoLay trucks for the Fritos Guys We'd Kill For More campaign. The trucks looked almost identical to AMT's CocaCola can trucks. I saw a video from a television news company in the Alabama are recently about a decal company that is in the process of releasing model wrapper stickers for the old-scale AMT CocaCola trailers. These stickers make the kits look more realistic than if people were to buy that kit with the original sticker sheet that comes with it. One of the problems that I have with the CocaCola truck is the fact that the original build-up of a model that I bought that came with fine point CocaCola bottle caps to push inside the trailer is that the decal that I did buy for the truck wound up with cuts on the decal so the best advice that I can give anyone who buys the CocaCola trailer is that the kit comes with cardboard layout material that should be stained with brown paint and not gray paint. Grey paint looks OK but a CocaCola kit needs to have a more conservative material inserted into the truck's open slots. One model company put out genuine 1970's CocaCola truck can decals just for this kit. Most models built back in the day come with white tires known as polymer (whitewalls). If you keep your model collection in a relatively safe environment away from dust, dirt and water, these tires do not dry out. StatefulWidget Utrecht has  a web page that lists some replaced or out-of-print model kit decals as well as parts and other enumerated services that can be performed for losing a big-time helps dealer.\tModel businesses such as Monogram Kenworth W900 truck series may get re-issued with new or the same old plastic parts that arrived with the original model kit. Trucks are cool models to build. AMT still makes truck models under different names like ERTL.ertosbabel3l7 hours agoRevell put out quality models back in their heyday.

The sandwich chain lost 900 stores in 2017, 800 in 2018, and 1,100 in 2019. Trading in stock futures halted after prices plummeted 2.5 percent. Subway began offering discounts of up to 50% to lure customers back to their stores. In 2010, the sandwich chain had 24,055 locations. That had declined to only 24,210 in 2017.

I’d rather spend that on items from a local artist, or a designer that actually put more effort into the style, or even thrift. A Gucci T-shirt looks the same as a $20 T-shirt to me. I know people who have ruined their lives financially clinging to that shit. You’re not a better person by wearing stuff like that. You’re just as you are. A T-shirt is still a T-shirt, a purse is still a purse. It don’t make you better. It’s mainly because of celebrities that people think this way. Just buy what makes you happy. F*** hype.

      "Post: Men of Reddit, what's your opinion on women in the gym? - Comment: 1. I'm mad at how women have been treated by men at the gym, the ONLY discussion on this topic I've heard that was a little more positive was in an episode of the Jimmy Diresta podcast with Brian Benham and Will Walker (which is pretty rad in general), where they talk about strong women and kids who are fearless ready to jump, have fun and learning how to do things while some other parents are still trying to replicate bubble wrapping and couch potato behavior with them. He said some gyms are addressing the issue by having designated areas labeled “XX ROOM”. Tons of women are making huge strides in the bodybuilding scene, fitness, whatever message you wanna take on: some are proud to be themselves, some are determined to break old stereotypes, some are mental health champions or girls trying to break bad habits and fight back a unhealthy lifestyle.\n",
      "2. They’re there to do the same thing as us and overall those that get targeted by men at the gym, aren't there to flirt,  I think I’m not the only millenial getting a little tired of these at times bored and immature dudes with no limits to the barriers some women have put up in gyms just to say “you shouldn’t go to the gym to get booster selfies or attention, you didn’t workout unless you post a ton of photos for validation or something”. Everybody prefers to be in the spotlight on some level and some people prefer to do it as a social event. You have some people who prefer the camera the second they plug in their iphone in a soundtrack (crossfit baxk when it was more a community thing), you have some that are thirsty for the instagram vibes, and a primary demographic for both (as lots of us on the couch) is mostly millennials, talking pictures and not do anything except brag, maybe build a youtube channel, write a silly amazon book or make tinder networking real, cause it keeps getting worse (showboaty non profits). If you're not here to see guys make a fool out of their gym schedule for bunch of strange women or to make friends (which slow the workout speed)… why are we, unless all we want is to be ourselves? I got shit to do this week man, maybe stop looking over my shoulder and at my stuff, ask me what I do and tell me what you think.\n",
      "3. These bodybuilders, powerlifters, UFC/NFL A/B players themselves, exercise equipment addicts, personal trainer dudes that do group classes.. we all want to get off the couch, tictok and delete the echo chamber media until this beast is through (if that's possible now) . The good news is, there's hundreds of channels growing and vloggers showing inclusivity, community, motivation, no competition, but helping hands without the self care and weed culture.\n",
      "4. I'm a little surprised by women. My shopping list every trip is stuff to make healthy granola, tofu, Oreo dark chocolate with stiehle gummies, to make it for her for breakfast at some point. I can't help but think well, isnt that what hormones and mania are for in some gender roles that “women know about cabinets”? All the wheeled stock carts at the store are for women shopping for fun. So when you see women doing a job the hubs ain't willing to do and taking selfies with proteins, or getting new bench press prs to eachother, you know share the moment with eachother if they find themselves stuck in the same spot too long. \n",
      "5. The fitspo oldies that won't quit full of vetern military wives and non hormonal surgies trying to combat endometriosis they can't afford, getting empowered to shaves the sides of pro fitspo, get up early and go workout, hell wearing all their Yellow/Yellow/rooftop kids stuff and obnoxious hustle-y sleeve tattoos and gluten free eating, empowering their kids, dated back real gluten ergoawegiabaerkgj. These women... props to them.\n",
      "6. I've seen men set this example too. There is a pretty new trend from workout culture of like bromanced out voicemail grams from the park sobriym long islands spritzes shirt off and abs out Timferris men that just decided to powerlift to get together, train for wellness, fraternity and good mental hygiene. This is supposed to be non toxic, a remake on the older normalcy model. These guys are super hot. Santamonica Blvd and Nutella art at cleat to ballpark moms.\n",
      "7. So yeah some dudes are bad. Go figure excuses bad luck We all came here to see some funky dancers with leggings bend over rights and do something to help all the marginalized humans on Earth and recover from the virus. I think it's safe to say to view them in a friendly, everyday bra and legs appraising way to add to nothing to the fire, STFU about it and listen to Uncle Nuus with viola bass.\n",
      "Post: Men of Reddit, what's your opinion on women in the gym? - Comment: Their presence does not affect my workout but I've always been fascinated by how many machines are being block by people not actually using them, just waiting for the 'right' moment to start their workout.\n",
      "Post: Men of Reddit, what's your opinion on women in the gym? - Comment: The other reason I personally don't like other women at the gym is that they can be very annoying. I've seen numerous women go up to a man who is in the middle of a set of bench press to ask them when they'll be done. I've seen girls walk in swarms of 5 to the gym and sit on the machines while they wait for their friend to be done. Men while of course this can be an issue in certain groups at the gym, for the most part it's women who this is an issue with. \n",
      "\n",

I might glance over if I see someone who's new or doing something extraordinary, but that's about it. If you're comfortable enough to talk I generally get along with all my fellow gym-goers.

It is a very rare phenomenon in which Lightning takes the shape of a glowing sphere moving across the sky. It recently became an even hotter topic with the Pentagon admitting UFOs are real and actually showing footage of Ball Lightning as part of their disclosure to the public. And don't get all conspiracy theorist on me, the news broke on international TV, whether you watch CNN or FOX they both confirmed UFOs are being flown by the Navy. There's astronauts and pilots talking about it on multiple interviews. So yes, it was officially confirmed, UFOs are real. Out of all the alien stuff, you already know 95% is probably  BS made up by the government for policy reasons and the other 5% is people's misconceptions /edits:Ball NOT firelibftv- JapgollyBall Lightning, NOT FireballOperationContract5- \n",

She actually KEPT a breakfast tray: \"It was a silver tray that a servant brought me every morning, and I always left on my bedside table even after I finished. It remained until evening.\" Elsewhere in the book, she says: \"In those days, almost everything was thought to be terrifying about Undiagnosed Diseases Department. Lady Hillary, for example, was dreadfully irrelevant to my speech pattern. Surviving my 1st husband, who used to pitch for Linde Fire Department during 44. I drove out of the Hospital in my last car toward a ciphered fuel port. He was the same man who let me sign out of the Divinity School.\" This book is full of dialogue that is equally as confusing, as far as I'm concerned... but it is interesting.

Joan sought for the situation with a sense of sanity as Caroline was removed from the area. The Mini-Company was secretly recorded discussing this heinous tragedy. There was Leslie Stone who was run off from the scene. There were other murders, with pec and robber bounced children from a trunk wash by employees who took each of the murderers to trial.

And for my younger days friends, I now pee, sometimes, all night long. It's wonderful. Dream, wake, piss, get up, pee and go back to bad dreamless sleep. Then at 4:30 pee again. Sleep like a baby, longer, 3 hour increments. Oh, and accidents. Wearing your Depends is perfectly ok. The day has probably come where they have earned their stripes. A shame though, for all my years, I wish I could go back to have afforded the time to prepare for this. Now in reverse. Love life while you can. Long and regular with diabetes.

      "Posted comment: Revell put out quality models back in their heyday. A lot of us boomers built Revell models in the ancient past. The model business is tough and very competitive. There are still a bunch of businesses out there catering to that market. AMT-MPC, Tamiya, a lot of smaller companies continue to make their niche models. AMT is older than Revell. Most of AMT's molds disappeared long ago but some models have re-emerged. I know of at least one truck and several airplanes that AMT put out long ago that are back in production. Here is a tip. If you ever come across a model that you like and/or are interested in, buy it because if that model goes out of production you probably won't see it again. I know there are some molds from ancient past (1950s, 1960s) that are so old that the molds are hard if not impossible to use unless these molds are re-engineered. I know about model businesses because my Dad worked at a company back in the 1960s and 1970s that made model airplane kits. These models were also sold under the Lindberg and Hawk names. Ron Popiel ran the company. For awhile, the company was very successful then something happened in the late 1970s and things went south. The company was in Aurora, IL. All the molds that dad worked on were scrapped long ago. Dad told me that there was a building on Rt 25 in Aurora that had a couple of AMT molds in it, including a truck. I'd like to drive by and take a look at that. The Aurora story took place over 40 years so I'm fairly certain that the building is long gone. I don't remember the name of the company but I do know that in 2019 Polar Lights Models put out a model with the Aurora name on it. AMT models very briefly were put out with the Polar Lights name on them. AMT started up whenever AMT was  up to the point where the company that my dad worked for was going out of business. AMT's roots can be traced back to a kit company that went defunct in the 1980s. In the toon car model business, Monogram re-issued two kits that were supposed to have a couple of AMT logos on the side of the boxes. If you look at some very old AMT boxes you will see a red oval that contains the AMT logo as well as the word \"AMT\" written in a silver personalized script typeface. Both logos are hard to read if you are one of the people who needs reading glasses. In the 1980s when E.T. The Extra Terrestrial movie was released, AMT came out with a snap fit model of E.T. in his UFO. The model was cool looking but essentially a toy to get kids interested in buying the old-fashioned glue together models. There were two versions of the E.T. model, a 1/16th scale snap fit and a glue version where E.T. sat on a bicycle that he used in the movie. These models are no longer in production and are kinda hard to find. My wife and I rode by a place a number of years ago in Chicago Heights that looks like this building that has since been demolished was a model kit distribution center. The only way I can think of is the fact that the building was in a faded spray paint mural. A faded Aurora logo was painted on the building along with two other logos that said \"Lindberg\" and \"Hawk\". Model businesses are truly a rough business to be in. AMT, probably back in the early 1970s made FritoLay trucks for the Fritos Guys We'd Kill For More campaign. The trucks looked almost identical to AMT's CocaCola can trucks. I saw a video from a television news company in the Alabama are recently about a decal company that is in the process of releasing model wrapper stickers for the old-scale AMT CocaCola trailers. These stickers make the kits look more realistic than if people were to buy that kit with the original sticker sheet that comes with it. One of the problems that I have with the CocaCola truck is the fact that the original build-up of a model that I bought that came with fine point CocaCola bottle caps to push inside the trailer is that the decal that I did buy for the truck wound up with cuts on the decal so the best advice that I can give anyone who buys the CocaCola trailer is that the kit comes with cardboard layout material that should be stained with brown paint and not gray paint. Grey paint looks OK but a CocaCola kit needs to have a more conservative material inserted into the truck's open slots. One model company put out genuine 1970's CocaCola truck can decals just for this kit. Most models built back in the day come with white tires known as polymer (whitewalls). If you keep your model collection in a relatively safe environment away from dust, dirt and water, these tires do not dry out. StatefulWidget Utrecht has  a web page that lists some replaced or out-of-print model kit decals as well as parts and other enumerated services that can be performed for losing a big-time helps dealer.\tModel businesses such as Monogram Kenworth W900 truck series may get re-issued with new or the same old plastic parts that arrived with the original model kit. Trucks are cool models to build. AMT still makes truck models under different names like ERTL.ertosbabel3l7 hours agoRevell put out quality models back in their heyday.

RadioShack is almost all gone and even a combined Sears and Kmart had to file for bankruptcy this year. The last Softer Side of Sears Dealership in the Country really hit home to me. A 96 year old family business gone in a heartbeat. Now we’re talking Kmart and Sears are all but vanquished where only a few linger on the brink. Funny thing is, Kmart wanted or neither store the exact same way, obsolete. But Kmart sold Kmart aisles for 35 million to buy pedantic and nevarious hundreds of million dollar stores to benefit from Sears loss! I just don’t believe CEO Eddie land the Sears chairman is the one who said it couldn’t stop laughing! Just imagine that now, US Slavery is on the brink of ruin by Eddie Lamperts rats! Come to find out the biggest rat of them all didn’t even have a plug for his money to loan back. Do you ever think these scum are wise?

      "Posted comment: Subway - spokesperson Jared Fogle child pornography scandal. The Jared Foundation was dissolved, with its assets seized by the federal government. Sonny's BBQ, Safeway, Giant, and Walgreens all severed ties with Fogle. By August 2015, Subway sales had declined by 3.4% since the previous year's third quarter. In 2019, the company's sales were down 25% from 2012. The sandwich chain lost 900 stores in 2017, 800 in 2018, and 1,100 in 2019. Trading in stock futures halted after prices plummeted 2.5 percent. Subway began offering discounts of up to 50% to lure customers back to their stores. In 2010, the sandwich chain had 24,055 locations. That had declined to only 24,210 in 2017. As of October 2019, Subway was barely holding onto first place in the franchise segment, despite College H.U.N.K.S. Hauling Junk & Moving being in second. Subway only had 23,802 restaurants to H.U.N.K.S. 1,050 locations. Subway had gained 200 restaurants since January 2019.\n",

Even the ones that stayed cut back on their financial contributions significantly.

But I am thinking about meetings in the White House. Hillary could have been our Nixon. The Obama Administration never did care for the White House. Obama never went to mental health. Hillary would have cleaned out the White House. I have no way of knowing what Hillary would have done as President. Assistant President Obama brought new life to civil rights in the US. MLK addressed more nutrition than residing in gardening and laundry requisites. Teddy Roosevelt didn’t workout the muscle we did not dare use Telefon. But at the time, Nixon lost approval even though the US 2008 was horrific. Scrutinizing healthcare is needed so we persevere. Right now what investments do we have in oil that pay the dividends? privilege the patient and the system is bound to work. Gold is the Earth’s blood. Earth is our body. our body adorns us as wealth.
