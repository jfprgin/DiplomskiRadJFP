"1f2gpuo","I'm the child in this situation but I have been seeing my bf for the past 3 years behind my dads back. (dad is a fuckin OPP. old fashion. he's suppose to marry a man WITH money not someone with struggles) I graduated this year and got a job teaching kindergarten (less than a year out of high school lemme know if y'all want tips) so I can pull in enough cash to move my mom out of my dad's house. she has no clue about any of it, even me moving her out. voting democrat just might be the spill haha"
"1f2gpuo","My niece lost a tooth and threw it in the trash because the tooth fairy ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt show up last time,‚Äù and thought it meant she wouldn‚Äôt come at all if she ever had another lost tooth üòÇ it‚Äôs been days and hasn‚Äôt said a word of her tossing it.

"1f2gpuo","I was cleaning my 3 yr old's ears and he had dulce de leche in there from his morning breakfast. Let's just say I can tell when he's had dulce de leche the night before. "
"1f2gpuo","My son has stopped telling me he's going to go to sleep and is playing on his phone for a couple hours before bed.  Me and his mother are divorced so I only have him after school and every other weekend.  I don't mind he is on it, he's 9, I want him to be able to entertain himself and learn things with it.  But when I continue thinking he is asleep and checking in on him only to see him not even close to sleeping and it is hours past his bed time I'll have to start restricting it... I've already started cutting him off a half hour earlier every night to ease him into not being on it at all at night."
"1f2gpuo","Not my child, but a friend of mine found a diary her son was writing in. She was flipping through the pages and found a diary entry from him earlier this month disclosing that he, at 17, got his girlfriend pregnant and she moved out to live with her grandparents so she would not be hassled by him or my friend. My friend is... Devastated to say the least. They also mentioned that he had recently acquired a new job and quit school. She said she doesn‚Äôt know how to react to this as he turned 18 last month. I told her he‚Äôs an adult and he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten to that point so quickly if he were a shedwit. She says she is struggling with confrontational wording because she can blow up over a poor choice of wording. She‚Äôs also partly blaming herself because of being in college at a young age so she could leave an abusive home. Is there any advice anyone could give me to help her deal with her guilt and her betrayal? It‚Äôs really hardwatching her suffer like this."
"1f2gpuo","My 11yo daughter doesn‚Äôt want us to know she hates shopping at Justice now. She still says she loves it. It‚Äôs so sad to watch her still go in that overpriced tween store and be so obviously overwhelmed by the smell of cheap plastic, high pitched music and glaring fluorescent lights. I no longer try to direct her towards a smaller store or boutique. I just wait outside the store entrance for her to finish sniffing the displays at Justice. SMH!"
"1f2gpuo","My 7 year old was in the beginning stages (stealing from us) of a candy addiction that he started really hiding from me. So very sneaky. I found out when he bragged to his brother that he ‚Äúneeded‚Äù the 4 candy bars in his backpack for the day. 

Son, when you put it that way, it explains the bowels and the behavior issues you were having for the past year."
"1f2gpug","Makes no sense to me. If cars never broke, the auto industry would not it by any means go out of business. People still need new stuff or alternatives as well. Even if iPhones never broke no way people would never switch to anything else. Market is still supply vs demand. Cars are not companies that people rely on people having to repurchase the item multiple times in their lifetime. K cars and never wanting a new one isn‚Äôr correlated in anyway lol."

"1f2gpug","Revell put out quality models back in their heyday. A lot of us boomers built Revell models in the ancient past. The model business is tough and very competitive. There are still a bunch of businesses out there catering to that market. AMT-MPC, Tamiya, a lot of smaller companies continue to make their niche models. AMT is older than Revell. Most of AMT's molds disappeared long ago but some models have re-emerged. I know of at least one truck and several airplanes that AMT put out long ago that are back in production. Here is a tip. If you ever come across a model that you like and/or are interested in, buy it because if that model goes out of production you probably won't see it again. I know there are some molds from ancient past (1950s, 1960s) that are so old that the molds are hard if not impossible to use unless these molds are re-engineered. I know about model businesses because my Dad worked at a company back in the 1960s and 1970s that made model airplane kits. These models were also sold under the Lindberg and Hawk names. Ron Popiel ran the company. For awhile, the company was very successful then something happened in the late 1970s and things went south. The company was in Aurora, IL. All the molds that dad worked on were scrapped long ago. Dad told me that there was a building on Rt 25 in Aurora that had a couple of AMT molds in it, including a truck. I'd like to drive by and take a look at that. The Aurora story took place over 40 years so I'm fairly certain that the building is long gone. I don't remember the name of the company but I do know that in 2019 Polar Lights Models put out a model with the Aurora name on it. AMT models very briefly were put out with the Polar Lights name on them. AMT started up whenever AMT was  up to the point where the company that my dad worked for was going out of business. AMT's roots can be traced back to a kit company that went defunct in the 1980s. In the toon car model business, Monogram re-issued two kits that were supposed to have a couple of AMT logos on the side of the boxes. If you look at some very old AMT boxes you will see a red oval that contains the AMT logo as well as the word ""AMT"" written in a silver personalized script typeface. Both logos are hard to read if you are one of the people who needs reading glasses. In the 1980s when E.T. The Extra Terrestrial movie was released, AMT came out with a snap fit model of E.T. in his UFO. The model was cool looking but essentially a toy to get kids interested in buying the old-fashioned glue together models. There were two versions of the E.T. model, a 1/16th scale snap fit and a glue version where E.T. sat on a bicycle that he used in the movie. These models are no longer in production and are kinda hard to find. My wife and I rode by a place a number of years ago in Chicago Heights that looks like this building that has since been demolished was a model kit distribution center. The only way I can think of is the fact that the building was in a faded spray paint mural. A faded Aurora logo was painted on the building along with two other logos that said ""Lindberg"" and ""Hawk"". Model businesses are truly a rough business to be in. AMT, probably back in the early 1970s made FritoLay trucks for the Fritos Guys We'd Kill For More campaign. The trucks looked almost identical to AMT's CocaCola can trucks. I saw a video from a television news company in the Alabama are recently about a decal company that is in the process of releasing model wrapper stickers for the old-scale AMT CocaCola trailers. These stickers make the kits look more realistic than if people were to buy that kit with the original sticker sheet that comes with it. One of the problems that I have with the CocaCola truck is the fact that the original build-up of a model that I bought that came with fine point CocaCola bottle caps to push inside the trailer is that the decal that I did buy for the truck wound up with cuts on the decal so the best advice that I can give anyone who buys the CocaCola trailer is that the kit comes with cardboard layout material that should be stained with brown paint and not gray paint. Grey paint looks OK but a CocaCola kit needs to have a more conservative material inserted into the truck's open slots. One model company put out genuine 1970's CocaCola truck can decals just for this kit. Most models built back in the day come with white tires known as polymer (whitewalls). If you keep your model collection in a relatively safe environment away from dust, dirt and water, these tires do not dry out. StatefulWidget Utrecht has  a web page that lists some replaced or out-of-print model kit decals as well as parts and other enumerated services that can be performed for losing a big-time helps dealer.	Model businesses such as Monogram Kenworth W900 truck series may get re-issued with new or the same old plastic parts that arrived with the original model kit. Trucks are cool models to build. AMT still makes truck models under different names like ERTL.ertosbabel3l7 hours agoRevell put out quality models back in their heyday. A lot of us boomers built Revell models in the ancient past.

In 2019, the company's sales were down 25% from 2012. The sandwich chain lost 900 stores in 2017, 800 in 2018, and 1,100 in 2019. Trading in stock futures halted after prices plummeted 2.5 percent. Subway began offering discounts of up to 50% to lure customers back to their stores. In 2010, the sandwich chain had 24,055 locations. That had declined to only 24,210 in 2017. As of October 2019, Subway was barely holding onto first place in the franchise segment, despite College H.U.N.K.S. Hauling Junk & Moving being in second. Subway only had 23,802 restaurants to H.U.N.K.S. 1,050 locations. Subway had gained 200 restaurants since January 2019.

""Well, it appears she has something that almost never infected that way, but it did. The only way this could happen is from bad luck or a severely weakened immune system.""

""OR MAYBE she actually DOES have pneumonia! We already discussed her assorted ailments and know she has literally no immune system problems, right under your nose! You are right that it is very hard to get pneumonia, BECAUSE IT CAN KILL YOU!""

"1f2gpt8","1. I'm mad at how women have been treated by men at the gym, the ONLY discussion on this topic I've heard that was a little more positive was in an episode of the Jimmy Diresta podcast with Brian Benham and Will Walker (which is pretty rad in general), where they talk about strong women and kids who are fearless ready to jump, have fun and learning how to do things while some other parents are still trying to replicate bubble wrapping and couch potato behavior with them. He said some gyms are addressing the issue by having designated areas labeled ‚ÄúXX ROOM‚Äù. Tons of women are making huge strides in the bodybuilding scene, fitness, whatever message you wanna take on: some are proud to be themselves, some are determined to break old stereotypes, some are mental health champions or girls trying to break bad habits and fight back a unhealthy lifestyle.
2. They‚Äôre there to do the same thing as us and overall those that get targeted by men at the gym, aren't there to flirt,  I think I‚Äôm not the only millenial getting a little tired of these at times bored and immature dudes with no limits to the barriers some women have put up in gyms just to say ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt go to the gym to get booster selfies or attention, you didn‚Äôt workout unless you post a ton of photos for validation or something‚Äù. Everybody prefers to be in the spotlight on some level and some people prefer to do it as a social event. You have some people who prefer the camera the second they plug in their iphone in a soundtrack (crossfit baxk when it was more a community thing), you have some that are thirsty for the instagram vibes, and a primary demographic for both (as lots of us on the couch) is mostly millennials, talking pictures and not do anything except brag, maybe build a youtube channel, write a silly amazon book or make tinder networking real, cause it keeps getting worse (showboaty non profits). If you're not here to see guys make a fool out of their gym schedule for bunch of strange women or to make friends (which slow the workout speed)‚Ä¶ why are we, unless all we want is to be ourselves? I got shit to do this week man, maybe stop looking over my shoulder and at my stuff, ask me what I do and tell me what you think.
3. These bodybuilders, powerlifters, UFC/NFL A/B players themselves, exercise equipment addicts, personal trainer dudes that do group classes.. we all want to get off the couch, tictok and delete the echo chamber media until this beast is through (if that's possible now) . The good news is, there's hundreds of channels growing and vloggers showing inclusivity, community, motivation, no competition, but helping hands without the self care and weed culture.
4. I'm a little surprised by women. My shopping list every trip is stuff to make healthy granola, tofu, Oreo dark chocolate with stiehle gummies, to make it for her for breakfast at some point. I can't help but think well, isnt that what hormones and mania are for in some gender roles that ‚Äúwomen know about cabinets‚Äù? All the wheeled stock carts at the store are for women shopping for fun. So when you see women doing a job the hubs ain't willing to do and taking selfies with proteins, or getting new bench press prs to eachother, you know share the moment with eachother if they find themselves stuck in the same spot too long. 
5. The fitspo oldies that won't quit full of vetern military wives and non hormonal surgies trying to combat endometriosis they can't afford, getting empowered to shaves the sides of pro fitspo, get up early and go workout, hell wearing all their Yellow/Yellow/rooftop kids stuff and obnoxious hustle-y sleeve tattoos and gluten free eating, empowering their kids, dated back real gluten ergoawegiabaerkgj. These women... props to them.
6. I've seen men set this example too. There is a pretty new trend from workout culture of like bromanced out voicemail grams from the park sobriym long islands spritzes shirt off and abs out Timferris men that just decided to powerlift to get together, train for wellness, fraternity and good mental hygiene. This is supposed to be non toxic, a remake on the older normalcy model. These guys are super hot. Santamonica Blvd and Nutella art at cleat to ballpark moms.
7. So yeah some dudes are bad. Go figure excuses bad luck We all came here to see some funky dancers with leggings bend over rights and do something to help all the marginalized humans on Earth and recover from the virus.

I've seen numerous women go up to a man who is in the middle of a set of bench press to ask them when they'll be done. I've seen girls walk in swarms of 5 to the gym and sit on the machines while they wait for their friend to be done. Men while of course this can be an issue in certain groups at the gym, for the most part it's women who this is an issue with. 

Another thing, men in the gym do grunt and bang weights and yell, no doubt about it. However, the women who do are very few and far between. Women tend to be more annoying by talking constantly or sounding a little frantic. "

"1f2gps1","Not realizing how many calories are in what you‚Äôre drinking. Juices, milk, sodas, fraps, etc... can be much worse than any food you‚Äôre eating. This is one of the biggest factors."
"1f2gps1","Drinking your calories. Gatorade, fancy lattes, etc. all contain plenty of sugar and can amount to as many calories as a small meal. Drink mostly water. If you want caffeine, stick to black coffee or plain tea. Lowfat or skim versions of dairy milk, and unsweetened almond/soy milk (30-ish calories per cup vs. twice that in sweetened versions) only. Watch how that muffin is made and how much butter is on the toast. Dressings can be sneaky. Applebee's honey vinaigrette has more cals in 2 tablespoons than some people are taking in while on a calorie-restricted diet. Split entrees with your dining partner or get a to-go box as soon as your meal arrives for obligatory portion management. Sub out fries/onion rings for something less calorie-dense.

tl;dr: Be mindful of liquid calories if you're not seeing any progress. Eat the same stuff but less of it and you will gain less weight."
"1f2gps1","Thinking they can eat whatever they want as long as they exercise, most people are aware they need to eat less but seriously underestimate just how much they need to cut down on.

For context a ‚Äúlow calorie‚Äù option like a subway sandwich and chips is over 1000 calories .  And that‚Äôs just one meal that you can easily eat in 10 minutes. "

We fell too hard into the entitlement and dependence that destroyed all our ancestors dynasties then the higher up now is trying to feed us cake while we're under the guillotine.  I'm not from here, I added plenty of opinions on mine but the facts are still that if you embrace family again, if you embrace the Jones's pecks (1-4) lives into your own pecks lives then it spreads to legit day-to-day life.

"1f2gprj","It seems like Europeans mostly like living in Europe and identify proudly with their countries. They are European but don't seem as ashamed of their countries as Americans do. They seem very turned off of some of the EU politics. **  
The 2 cultural things I can that constantly come up with Europeans on Reddit are:  
-US healthcare is archaic  
-'light' American beer is garbage  
Beyond that I don't see much criticism of America from Europeans.  
There is a huge contingent of European Redditors who are mainly in favor of Brexit.   
The drawbacks of the EU I see mentioned on here is a heavy bureaucracy that is concerning.  
There are certain things about American society that seem to really disgust just about every European on Reddit. Notably:  
1. circumcision  
2. lack of vacation time  
3. obesity  
I've yet to see a European come to America and criticize our alcohol. They seem to really like our wine, as well.   
So from everything I've gathered here on Reddit, the Europeans have it pretty damn good! Does their economy grow fast enough, are they too affected by globalism? How about something like population replacement? The Europeans are white as hell! "

They‚Äôre slowly becoming a tier 2/3 superpower, propped up by its nuclear weapons and France‚Äôs ambitions, ironically due to the very reasons it lost both world wars - severe puniteness the European Union wants to stick down countries‚Äô throats. Slowly, Europe will fade into more irrelevancy than it is now: Asia will be ascendant, the Middle East will always be a problem, Africa could tip the balance and Joe Biden‚Äôs America first policy will be a reality for our lifetime. The idea that the European Union could be a superpower was always laughable but you could believe it just because that was what the average person reported up until recently in our lifetime. That being said, in my gut, there's gonna be a seismic worldwide shift by 2030. If not, by 2050. It could happen tomorrow. It ain‚Äôt gonna be good.

"1f2gprj","Struck By: Many countries across the european union are trying to gain sovereignty of economic policies from the European Central Bank and the Euro Stability Page

Reddit Comment: If –£ou do not know what monetary sovereignty means. it is the ability of an economy to print its own money and the capacity to create money despite a level of external debt. Many countries across the european union are trying to gain sovereignty of economic policies from the European Central Bank and the Euro Stability Pact. A lot of these countries believe that without them printing their own money they are very likely to suffer hyperinflation and have very little control of the value of the currency under the Euro currency system. Why having control of the monetary policy is so important in crisis times with brexit and more countries trying to leave the economic pact what do —Éou think is the futrue of the Euro as –∞ trading currency?"

The EU, like most continental-European countries, simply can‚Äôt take the strain that economic evils provide, for they can‚Äôt expect their magic single currency, appallingly restrictive regulations or well-meaning handouts to solve all their problems.

Which leads me to think these countries need to break away and reclaim their national autonomy for a lot of the world they were suddenly told is now looking at the EU with skepticism, according to this poll."
