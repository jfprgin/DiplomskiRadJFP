136jqkc,jipgu3y,"That's not exactly what he said. 

He said billionaires shouldn't exist. When pressed, he said it wasn't that the person shouldn't exist, but a system that allows people to accumulate that much wealth, where a small handful of people have more wealth then 70% of the nation, shouldn't exist. 

He wants to tax them at the rate they were taxed when Eisenhower was President, because if they were taxed like that, the excess wealth then goes back into their companies, their employees, charity, etc. 

Wallace kept pressing with the same ""So you want to confiscate everything over a billion?"" and then Bernie finally said ""They'd be fine with $999,999.""

People always say that he wants to take money from the rich, but he just wants a system that doesn't allow the rich to take money from everyone else. 

So, if legislation isn't going to be created to fix everything (let's face it, it never will be), the easiest route is to just raise their taxes.",289

Edit: a lot of people have offered the counterpoint that this argument is incomplete at best and misleading at worst, and I concede (to a point). The majority of people against taxing the ultrawealthy that I know, have spoken about their mistrust of the government. That mistrust, and what *about* the government they don't trust, is a separate and much deeper conversation to me.

These people have benefitted from a rigged system. The top marginal tax rate used to be 90%. Wages have been stagnant for 40 years. That is theft. The system has been rigged to perpetuate the ability of a small subset of people to unduly influence the outcome. Enough is enough.",4

I just seen something saying a CEO just got 250m for a years work but how many people actually DO 250m worth of work? I’m guessing no-one!

They’re rewarded for making other rich people richer, no-one is getting grossly overpaid for making society/services better! 

Yet here we are, the rich continue to reward all those who continue to exploit everything they can in every way possible to make them richer and ruining everything along the way and its rather sad to watch people un-willing to stand up in unity to put a stop to it.

So no, I don’t support this idea in practice. It would be ineffective at doing what it’s supposed to do.

I do, however, support finding other ways to tax wealth. It’s necessary, because at the moment people who earn money via labor (vs. via capital appreciation) are shouldering way too much of the tax burden. 

Progressive consumption tax, removing the stepped up basis, and larger estate taxes are all interesting ideas.",3

It tells the story of how the Kennedy and Johnson administrations got the United States into the Vietnam war, and it particularly zeroed in on Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. He kept escalating the conflict at every turn, and if you questioned him he could bury you in data showing that the US was winning the war and the Defense Department just needed more troops and more money to put us over the top. I'm grossly oversimplifying a great book, but that's the gist of it. 

A great companion piece to the book is a documentary called The Fog Of War by Errol Morris. It's a one on one interview with Robert McNamara filmed near the end of his life where he ruminates on the lessons he's learned.

So this 60 something year old suffers from an acute complication and gets a Pacemaker to solve the problem.

The man then prooceds to never show up to any appointment and never answear any calls from the hospital to know of him and reschedule. This went on for around 3 years. Until he shows up without former warning and asks to talk with the doctor that did the procedure to put his pacemaker. People are weirded out but seeing that on that day the doctor was present and this patient was in clear distress, they talk to him and manage a couple of minutes to have the doctor check on him.

Inside the appointment room, the doctor takes notice that this man is wearing a bra inside his shirt. The man explains he has been wearing his daughters bra for 3 months after his ""problem"" got worse. The shirt is asked to be taken off and there he stands, the shirtless man wearing his daughters bra, showing off the pacemaker, that should have been kept inside his body, dangling outside of it, being hold by the left bra cup, with a big infected open wound above it with the pacemaker leads still inserted onto his veins and connected to his heart.

Nobody has any idea how the man let that situation come to be or how he didnt die of sepsis or any other health problem that may appear for that matter.

I have no doubt he tore a strip off the parents once their five-year-old was stabilized, and they probably still felt justified and angry at the surgeon for telling them what they could and could not feed their child right before anesthesia.

When a crime is committed the police, at least American police, are committed to making sure someone is arrested and goes to jail, now whether that is the correct person, that's where things get dicey.

I don't have jerk kids. But I do think I've learned a lot from having 4 very different kids, and I think too many parents 1. Think the same strategies work for all kids (ie, rule-consequence-behavior falls in line, rinse and repeat) and 2. Focus on the behavior rather than the cause.

If you have a kid who doesn't respond to your parenting style/philosophy, you should rethink your approach. It's not all the kid's fault.

Some kids will burn their lives to the ground to make a point. I have one like that. For too long, it was a vicious cycle of

* kid acts out
* I punish
* kid is angry, acts out more
* I punish harder
* kid is angrier, acts out even more
* I punish even harder

and on and on and on and on. Something needs to break the cycle.

For instance, if your kid is challenging your authority, it's usually a bid for more independence. They're trying to be more mature, and they want your adult respect. You don't have to excuse the bad behavior; consequences are OK. But you ALSO have to look for ways to help your kid get that need met.

You don't have to tie it to the actual incident, so it doesn't look like a reward. Give them more responsibility for themselves.

* Let him walk to school alone if he doesn't get to do that.
* Quit bugging him so much about what he does with his free time, even if you think he should be ""getting more fresh air.""
* Look for any opportunity to let him choose something. ""We're going to do something as a family on Sunday. You can choose what we do."" or where we eat or whatever.
* Don't tell him WHEN he has to do his chores. Let him set his Saturday schedule: ""I need you to mow the lawn and do the dishes today. You can do it any time between now and 6 p.m.""

If you address the cause of the behavior, it's going to do way more to correct a bad behavior, and you'll also get more respect from your kid.

If you insist on winning every power struggle, your kid is going to see everything as a fight.

These parents may consciously “provide” for their kids while they unconsciously sabotage them. The kids pick up on this and end up aspiring to their parents’ unspoken expectations.

Good parents want their kids to exceed their own achievements and, most importantly, to be happy. Good parents are empathetic to their children. They’re happy when their kids are happy.

But think about it like this, would you rather build a skyscraper on land or on the sea? Children have less barriers to learning good behaviors if they have a stable and consistent environment OF GOOD EXAMPLES TO LEARN FROM AND PRACTICE. They can also only do that if THEY TRUST YOU, and to do that, you need to build a healthy relationship, and BE the example for them to learn from.",132

To the extent that all 3 of her kids were estranged from her for a bit, but 2 of them (including my uncle ""Ed"") have been reconnected for decades.

My uncle, vowing to never be this strict with his kids, essentially just never disciplined his kids. Whenever Ed and my Aunt Lana had an issue with them, the kids could go to Ed and get out of it because he was kind of a pushover. They grew up to be rude, didn't respect curfews at like age 12. The son always had some sort of issue (my family is very hush hush about mental health, I think it's ADHD) that led to angry bursts as a kid and they tried their best with medication but it kind of mellowed him out into a shell of himself till they found a better med combo.

Another thing that may play a role is they're half black (my side) and half white (Ed's side). I won't pretend to know if there was an identity issue growing up, but I was very judgmental of them because they kind of both tried to act ""ghetto"" like they grew up in a tough neighborhood with a hood accent and I'm like.. No you grew up in one of the most affluent neighborhoods in the state with both parents and a lot of chances.

So yeah, last year my mom admits to me both of the cousins got into drugs and had to go to rehab. Again, knowing my family they'd freak out at weed but I think it was that and also opiates. And I'm just shaking my head thinking that this is kind of all on my cousins.",756

I was adopted, and told a silly, magical story about my birth parents that most certainly did not seem true even when I was a child. 

At 57, I learned I was the result of a college affair between a very seriously Jewish young man and a very Baptist young woman. She was rushed off to a home for wayward girls to give birth. He followed her there (many states away), begging her to keep me and live a life together.  But their families both said absolutely not. Jewish people were not viewed as ""white"" in the mid-60s, and her family most certainly did not want her marrying a non-white. Plus, she was a very committed Christian and did not want to convert to Judaism. 

So off I went, into another family. I recently discovered three lovely half-siblings and we are all pro or semi-pro musicians and get along well. I never got to meet my mother; she died a year before I searched. My father is out of the picture and wants to be left alone. And I'm fine with that; I'm grateful for the love he gave me. It was enough. 

Another person that was in my non-bio family was also adopted. She was older than me. She tracked down her mom later in life, too. She was in a hospital and had been since the day she was born. She was born holistically disabled; physical, mental, cognitive, learning, sensory. And was raped by an orderly. And she discovered she was the result.

The soon to be husband was sitting on his bed that was in the living room watching TV and the bride was in the kitchen with two kids on either hip. She told me to sit at the kitchen table to go over the wedding details. She shouted at her fiance to come and join the meeting where he didn't acknowledge that I was there to talk about shooting their wedding. The bride was annoyed, then asked if I saw the bucket full of dirty diapers on the porch. I said that I had, and she said her fiancee has so many kids with other women that is the only place to keep them so they don't stink up the house. 

I did not take the job. I always wondered what happened to that couple.",11861

Different wedding, saw the groom down an entire bottle of wine in one go when he finally had a minute to himself. I took the picture thinking it was just going to be a goofy moment, until later on while I was editing pictures, I realized what I was seeing.

Oh wait, another one, the bride was 30 minutes late, when I was in the room with the bride while she was getting ready, she told bridesmaids how her sister drove her all around town because she couldn't make up her mind  about if she really wanted to get married.",3356

It was always a bad sign whenever I saw the groom smash the cake into the bride's face during the first bite when she didn't.

He says ""I have the rest of my life to sit next to her"".

The gasp from both sides of the family was AUDIBLE. Everyone was horrified. He did not move.

Bride spent the rehearsal dinner crying in the bathroom. 

They still went through the wedding the next day, which was in October. She kicked him out and filed for divorce AND annulment (Catholic) by that December.",230

The minister then asked the groom's friends & family to do the same thing. Dead silence.

The minster, very flustered, said ""hey how about I give you folks another chance"" and again asked the groom's friends & family to affirm their support of this marriage. This time - dead silence.

Minister continued with the ceremony. Couple lasted maybe a few years.

EDIT: Alot of people have been asking, so here is a bit more backstory. My guess as to why people were holding the Dad back was that the Groom was in full Marine dress uniform and they used his sword to cut the cake, that sword was very much in arms reach of the Groom after this happened, so everyone was probably worried something really bad could happen if those two got near each other. After the incident, it was really awkwardly silent as the Groom apologized to the family and if I remember correctly (this was 10 years ago or so) him and the Dad went outside for around 20 minutes, then came back in.

During the vows I don't touch the camera, just step back and let it run. So I'm spaced out waiting for the vows to finish and notice a radio tower far across the valley. Suddenly lightning hits the radio tower. I had enough time to think ""Boy when the thunder gets here it'll probably loud."" 

I also had enough time to clue in that the minister was saying ""If anyone objects to this union let him speak now or forever..."" KEBLAMMMMMMMM!

His best story (and one of the reasons he stopped including the question) was a couple where the lead up to the wedding the couple was obviously in love. The bride to be was very smiley and happy. Day of the wedding she’s stone faced. He knows something is up because he’s never seen her like this and he asks if she is ok. “I’m fine.” 

Right before the service he asks again. “I’m fine.”

He gets to the question, “Does anyone object to this union?”

The bride reaches over, grabs the maid of honor, shoves her into the bride’s spot and says, “You’re screwing him, you marry him.” And then stormed out of the church.",25192

Like it's not a fun jokey moment, it's a real legal part of the ceremony.

He also said it used to be custom that if you raised an invalid objection you then had to pay for the wedding.",10903

When that part came up, she said “I object. But does it really matter? They are going to to do it anyway.”

Without too much “back in the day” talk I’ll just say the groom was/is a good friend of mine I’d known since middle school (7th grade). 

He’d met this awesome gal and they were slated to be married in our then early 30’s. 

Come the wedding day and it’s almost a high school reunion of sorts (we attended a smallish private school), everyone stoked to see our grade school pal get married. 

We’re all seated outside waiting for the bride to come out and a reasonable amount of time goes by. People are just carrying on, catching up etc. I’ve got a flask and sharing it with people. The groom goes inside to see what’s up..

More time goes on, then some more, then my flask is empty and I want to go reload at the car but think better of it. 

Then the groom comes back out to address everyone and let’s us know that “this isn’t happening today, the bride doesn’t want to go through with it. We’re still together and everything but now isn’t the time….” then goes on to encourage everyone to eat the food, it’s already paid for etc. 

Here we are about 5 years later and they’re still together but not married. No harm, no foul I guess?",635

It was before the ceremony was about to begin, me and my brother overheard my uncle, who has never gotten along with my aunt, talking to the groom and basically told him ""You're better off running lad. Her past three marriages have all ended up dead, all due to car crashes. Bit odd that, don't you think.""

The groom thought this was indeed odd, and decided to ask myself and my brother, two of our cousins and our other aunt if what my uncle said was true. We told him it was, and thought the bride would have told him before hand. Turns out she never disclosed the fact she had been previously married before. So the groom, for all intents and purposes, fled the church. 

Safe to say it was a dramatic day after that.",214
13ec6op,jjqcel1,"Well, sort of. It was staged, pre arranged, and the minister was warned ahead of time. 


The couple said they wanted to make the ceremony more interesting. So they had a friend object, declaring his love for the bride in  an over the top dramatic speech. 


The best man (my husband) stabbed the guy with a stage dagger, he played dead, and two of the other groomsmen dragged his limp body away. The wedding proceeded.

Quality dog toys are at least $20 and often don't last as long as I would like (except MonsterK9 and King Chew, very well worth it) for my heavy chewer. Grooming is costly, flea and tick protection is costly, treats are costly, everything about owning a dog is so much more than it used to be, even though canine care wasn't as quality as it is now. Heck, my first dog didn't cost this much to care for and he was a frequent flyer at the vet for his health issues",422

He had his whole family on board.  Weather was closing in.  He agreed that it was impossible to get home, but wanted to make it to a larger municipal airport so they wouldn't have to stay in a motel.  The fuel attendant and a bunch of old veteran pilots hanging around the airport office all said they'd drive him to a nicer place, but he thought he'd have a better chance of getting out the next day from the other airport.  Conditions weren't *that* bad when he took off, but we all agreed later that no one without instrument rating would/should have flown that day.

Apparently my great grandfather had been an Air Force pilot stationed in the UK during WW1.  He had a girlfriend at the time named Edith! After the war was over they broke up. GreatGrandpa returned home and married great grandma shortly after. They had only one child, a girl, whom he named Edith. 

Roughly 18 months later my great grandmother saw a letter in the mail from an Edith and figured it out. She vowed the child would NEVER be called the damn name ever again.  She went by her middle name Mary. Though it was never legally changed.

141dfp5,jmzo358,"Undefeated 7 & 8 year old little league baseball coach! 



Especially proud because I was given what they though was a castaway squad. Our tactics we non conventional but we freaking crushed.


Edit:


For those asking about non-traditional tactics. Basically all plays are at first. We don't care if there is a runner on 2nd we are throwing the ball to 1st, where we have our best catcher. We always were shifted away from 3rd base to make the throw to 1st as easy as possible. You might get burned 1-2 times a game by a kid hitting it down the 3rd baseline but in general it was rare enough that defending 3rd was a waste of a player. 95% of balls in play are going to be between shortstop and 1st because 7&8 year olds are hitting for contact and do not know where they are going to hit it, so we packed those areas that give us the best chance for a play at 1st and went there every time.


Also I found it benefited the team more to work with making our weaker players stronger and not focusing on our superstars. This allowed every kid to play more because your studs are going to be good no matter what and probably were getting extra work at home anyways. So I always focused on bringing the bottom players up to par with the rest of the squad and I think that was ultimately the difference more that my janky defense.",4260

My most recent example was when my partner and I were in Muji, an Asian-themed home goods and clothing store.  The ambience of these stores are super chill, with diffusers going, soft music, and so on.  As we were coming in a woman was losing her mind on the cashier because a pair of socks scanned up at let's call it $10 when they should have been $8.  Numbers are made up because this was a month or so ago.  She is arguing impressively that these socks scanned up wrong and they should be free.  The cashier has the ""wut"" look on her face and is calmly explaining, that no, she can get a refund for the difference.  This lady was not having it, seemingly pulling what she believed was the ultimate trump card, she shouted ""well other stores have policies where they give you the wrong scanned item for free!"".  The cashier again, without a breaking a sweat said ""well, that isn't our policy.  I can either refund you the difference, refund you the whole thing, or you keep it as it is.""  This loop went on for much longer than it had to before the angry customer relented, visibly disturbed that this made-up policy did not exist at Muji.

Retired Military.

Gun Owner.

I think the biggest problem in the US is not so much guns but gun culture.  It's how the gun lobby and an entire subset of the population has romanticized a tool for killing. 

We have a lot of problems in this country between media radicalizing the public against each other. Inadequate mental healthcare.  Financial inequality.  It is a breeding ground for violence.  But then you add in a culture that makes highly efficient killing machines easily accessible to these same people and you have a recipie for disaster.

I have my guns.  They are locked up.  I am fully trained on how to use, and maintain them. I don't want my kids getting hands on them.  I don't want a thief getting hands on them.  They are present for their intended purpose and I hope I'm never put in a position where I have to use them.

Gun philosophy in the US has merits but has one unavoidable key flaw.  People, as a collective, are unreliable.  I can ensure that I am trained and responsible.  I can make sure my family is trained and responsible.  But I have no control over anyone else.  If my neighbor is an idiot or having a mental health crisis what will they do with having access to a tool that kills easily, at range with very little effort?",1892

You can only do that with long guns/unregulated firearms. You can't drive to another state, have a Maryland ID and buy a regulated firearm in another state that is illegal in maryland. If a specific type of AR was illegal Maryland and I was a Maryland resident, if I drove to PA and tried to buy said illegal in Maryland AR, as soon as the PA gun dealer saw my Maryland ID they would turn me away and not sell me said firearm.

It looks good, but the design of it is what you might expect if you told aliens what a trash can is and they designed one without ever seeing it. How it holds the bag basically causes you to lose 4 gallons of capacity and have to risk tearing the bag or spilling its contents every time you go to remove it. It also has a trash bag holder that is so narrow, you have to feed it trash bags one at a time, completely defeating the point. And if you try to compact the trash a bit, you're almost guaranteed to tear the ""tear resistant"" bag.

The idea is great! Open, use, reseal.

But in my experience (and I'm not exactly old and weak) these don't work as planned. Frequently they have the perforated section you can rip off, supposedly to allow access to the ziploc portion. Many times there's glue holding pieces together and the perforated section never seems to extend past that.

Even when not glued, the ziploc is apparently held together by the weak nuclear force and will NOT come apart. There's never enough plastic to pull on, and when there is it's approximately as strong as wet tissue paper. So it just rips.

IMHO the worst offenders are deli meats, but it's been tortillas and more that have flummoxed me. Far too often I just take scissors to the package and then 'seal' it later with a clothes pin.",1894

Edit: I had no idea this would get attention but I’m so glad it did.  Here’s a summary of some tips (thank you to many of the ppl in this thread for their own experiences and tips too!!)

What you should know:

1.  Your patient rights.  You can ask for a referral to a specialist. You can ask for second opinions.  You can ask to see what is in your chart.  Know your rights.

2. If you have a family member in a hospital or long term care home, please visit and be there as much as possible.   When you are sick or old you are just not able to summon the energy to be on top of Med errors or even general care.   The more eyes on the care and environment the better for your family member.

3.  Advocate for your family member.  Do some research too:  what is the illness? What are some options?  And take these to the doctor and ask if they’re appropriate (with the patients consent obviously) for the patient.


4.  Follow up.  If the office doesn’t call you : FOLLOW UP.  Keep following up with offices, pharmacies, specialists, etc.  until you’re satisfied.


5. If you are in the States, review your bill. Go over every item and see what can be negotiated and hound them until you feel it’s fair.  The squeaking wheel gets the grease.


5.  Get a job in health care.  Not a clinician? No problem: environmental services and portering are excellent well-paying entry-level jobs that can get you potentially into a union.  You will learn hospital and health care really fast.  


6. Before your family member goes home from hospital make sure you see a “discharge planner” or a “social worker” to talk about discharge.  Hospitals are full and they usually are pressed to send people home fast with health care at home being an option: but it’s not the only option.  Talk to the discharge planner and push back if you need to.  Look up questions to ask the discharge planner.


7.  If you want the doctor to do/prescribe/refer something and they CHOOSE NOT TO, you are within your rights to say “May I have that option noted in my chart?  I’d like to keep track of what I’ve asked you about”.   Innocent, right?  Well it’s a good way to get the clinician to think about whether they want their rebuttal of your suggestion in the chart.

8. If it feels wrong, please see someone else.  Don’t just blindly trust health professionals.  They’re people too.  They’re not magic.  Some are better than others.  read clinician reviews so you at least know what to expect.


To all those folks who go into appts with chronically ill family, or partners, you are guardian angels.   Keep doing what you’re doing.  It is more supportive (and the optics for the clinicians matter) than you know.",12068

12whjgh,jhgc8y8,"In the 1980s, there used to be a small ad every week in the back pages of the UK actors' magazine The Stage, for a guy called David Berglas. It was just his silhouette, his name, his agent's phone number and the caption: International Man of Mystery. 

The simple genius of it was so giddying that I felt compelled to steal it when I wrote the program notes for one of the performers in a student comedy show I directed. 

Another performer in that show was a guy called Neil Mullarkey, who went on to form a double act with a young Canadian comedian called Mike Myers. He and Mike both loved that phrase, but neither of them knew where I'd got it from, so Mike just stole it again.

Decades later, I got in touch with David Berglas (then aged 90) via his son and apologised for nicking it. He got back to say he was delighted to find out how Mike Myers had come by that phrase, and told me I'm forgiven. He's still alive today and nearly a hundred years old.

Berglas was a truly great magician, a huge star of British TV in the 50s and 60s and deserves acknowledgement for that brilliant strap line. I'm also sheepishly proud of my part in the chain of theft that led to Austin Powers.",7111

First of all, only part of the team are drillers. There are still astronauts actually flying the shuttles. All the drillers were trained to do was spacewalk and survive while drilling in space. Secondly, the film shows that they did try training astronauts how to drill but they were failing at it. Bruce Willis’s character had created the most advanced drill that was needed to drill the asteroid but it was complicated to use. With the time crunch, Bruce Willis explained that there was not going to be enough time to teach them properly and it would be easier to teach the experienced drillers how to do spacewalks.

The virus flipped the binary system on the ship.  0s turned to 1s and 1s turned to 0s.   The reason we could do this with a computer is because our technology was based on theirs from the ship at area 51. 

Also, they had protections against said virus, which is why the ships didnt fall out of the sky when the virus went live.  The communication system and the energy system are the same system so if you affect coms you affect the energy source.  

The ship basically went into a ""safe mode"" where some features, like shields, didnt work.  That is why the time frame for us to strike was ""only a few minutes"".   Our virus only made a dent in their system but it was just enough to affect energy supply and thus bring down the shields. 

Think Star Trek when the ship is damaged enough the shields dont work.  

So yes, the virus plot line was totally plausible.  

*************************

The energy and coms system being the same is from the books.  

Us learning from their ships at area 51 is from the books and deleted scenes.

Thankfully, that interaction resulted in my kids no longer having to take so much ""medicine"" which was my main issue because I could see that it was eroding their confidence.

""I will never argue with a flat-earther, or an anti-vaxxer, or any of those people. The reason is because that these people have made that into _their whole identity_, and they are prepared to address any possible argument I could come up with. And because I care about facts and truth and they do not, my only possible response would be '...uh, I'll have to look into that, I don't know off the top of my head'. It doesn't matter that their response is incorrect or based on faulty research or has been rejected by the scientific community or whatever; by the time I discover that, they will be long gone and talking about how they won another debate.""

This is it in a nutshell. If you argue about an issue with someone who has made _that one issue_ into the core of their persona, you will lose unless you are someone who has made arguing against that issue also into the core of your persona.

16ycbve,k393jbc,"This might be a bit niche, but there was an old 3rd person infighting shooter back in about 2006 called Gunz: The Duel.

Gunz combined small-map, counter strike style shooting, with fast paced anime style skill moves and melee combat. You could dash, wall run, block bullets with swords etc.

What made it unique and memorable was that players quickly learned to exploit these mechanics. For example, you could dash forward, block the dash with a guard, jump, dash again, swing your sword, block again, switch to your shotgun, fire off a shot, switch back to your sword and repeat. 

This style of play was discovered by a Korean audience, and so, got dubbed ‘K-Style.’ It quickly became the only way to really survive in Gunz at all. You had to learn a crazy amount of intricate combinations and skill cancels - but if you did, you could jump around off walls and ceilings, deflecting bullets, firing shotguns, and slashing your weapon, all in one fluid movement. This made for crazy intricate duels. It also must have brought about early onset arthritis in a lot of people.

The steep learning curve meant that Gunz had a small but hardcore fanbase, but stopped it ever being a mainstream success. The developer quickly developed Gunz 2: The Second Duel in response - removing all of the mechanics that made K style possible.

On one hand, I get their intention, and maybe Gunz would never have been a huge commercial success. On the other, removing K style took out the very thing that made Gunz unique. The second game is just a soulless, dated shooter.

It’s a shame - if they’d embraced the way that their fanbase wanted to play the game, they might have made something special.",810

""Broad appeal"" doesn't exist, especially with a show based on a game about a super soldier killing aliens. The whole reason Halo has become one of the most recognisable game titles of all time was because it focused on a super soldier killing aliens. They moved away from that to make it more about Master Chiefs love affair with a rogue human inside the Covenant, the group of human hating aliens Chief should be killing. 

They also broke core tenants of the original games lore which made it Halo in the first place: Master Chief takes off his helmet. Chiefs relationship with Cortona. Humans in the Covenant (in lore, the Prophets looked to wipe them out as their existence contradicted their religion), Spartans having a control chip and not being loyal to Dr. Catherine Halsey. Replacing Spartan Blue Team with Silver team just to have more storylines about removing the control chips, and the Spartans not caring about finishing their mission no matter the cost (in the finale the Covenant leadership was right there, and they ignored them to save one of their own).

On a grander scale, there’s this idea of not letting your children suffer. We all know it’s important to let them struggle a little to learn how to cope. 

But one no one ever talks about is allowing your child to mourn a loss. If a beloved toy breaks, go buy a replacement ASAP! If a pet fish dies, go buy a replacement ASAP! You’re teaching the kid to just replace things they’ve lost instead of processing the loss. So what happens when they lose something that can’t be replaced? They don’t know what to do or how to handle it. Like, let your kid cry over their dead fish for a few days and bury it in the garden with some flowers before asking if they’d like another.

People think it’s small, oh it’s just a toy, but losing a beloved toy is likely the closest thing a kid has to losing a person or a pet they’ve had for years like a dog. Let them learn to mourn their lost teddy bear so they’ll build those processes and when older, can mourn the family dog, etc.",685

For some people it’s really important, but if it isn’t to you then I think that’s fine. There isn’t one cookie-cutter right way for a healthy and supportive relationship to form, develop, and be maintained. I think our longevity has more to do with both of us constantly working on our communication & self reflection skills, learning to curb our egos or take space (and respect space) when we can’t, and staying together because we want to not because we feel like we have to.

Obits are expensive. Like, $400 for a single day expensive. And they are priced by the word. We had funeral homes who would send us obits with all the commas and periods separated to make full new words. The homes would get the estimate from our website and use that for billing the grieving family. We would edit the obit to meet English standards, which would reduce the word count substantially, dropping the price. In other words, they charged for the estimate but got billed for the edit.

It got so bad management told us we were not allowed to talk about prices with family members, even if they came in and showed us the bill from the funeral home. The ""customer"" was the home, not the family, so they weren't privileged to see the pricing.

He never asks questions or expresses any interest in their lives. My son puts up with it because he can direct some of the conversation by bringing up sports or interesting historical stuff or books or whatever and then they can have somewhat of a discourse (although listening to the inevitable droning lecture is always included).

For the removal if you want to talk about the secular state this perspective argues that the Pledge of Allegiance should reflect the principle of separation of church and state.

And some people argue that the phrase excludes individuals who do not identify with theism or monotheistic beliefs.

But in terms of opposing the removal you can argue on the grounds of historical context as it can be said  the Pledge of Allegiance was added in the 1950s to distinguish the United States from atheist communist countries during the Cold War. Some individuals would also consider the phrase a reflection of the nation's cultural and moral values.

Then one day we had to look after a friend's lab because she had to go to a job interview or something, I can't remember why. But this meant there were now three black dogs and one white. They all ran through the house past the sofa table where the cat was lounging. He didn't care about the first lab mix he knew. He didn't care about the samoyed mix. He didn't care about the new lab.

My dog gets slightly confused at first IF I’ve been away (like if I have to leave him with my parents and one of my sisters goes over, he thinks it’s me and runs over all excited), but realizes it soon as he gets close enough to smell them, but it’s not me.

When the whole family is together, and I leave for a minute, she might get confused for a few moments and think that I’m still there (because she sees my twin) but will realize her mistake and run to find me. Overall, she’s not confused between the two of us but is thrilled to have a second version of me.

Edit: I’m seeing a ton of comments saying that dogs identify people by scent. Which is mostly true, but my dog definitely gets confused when she’s several yards away from me and/or my twin.

I bought tickets. Two days before the show, I told her that the friend I originally planned to take couldn’t go, and would she please come with me? There was no other friend. Told her I loved the band and would be sad to miss them. She of course accepted, and had the time of her life. 

She’s doing much better now, but every couple of Christmases or Birthdays, she gets me some Death Cab merchandise because “she knows how much I love the band.”

I knew HTML, so I made a fake website for a Australian gaming magazine advertising a competition to win an Xbox. He “entered the competition” and “won” it. We faked the email telling him he’d won.

15isppg,juwa02x,"I've had type 1 diabetes since I was 3. On my 9th birthday, my grandma made a birthday cake for me, which was big enough for us all to share at the family party. Since there was so much food, we had plenty of leftover cake for the next few days, which I was only allowed to eat a little bit of. 

When no one was around, I snuck into the kitchen and ate a couple slices of the leftover cake, plus I picked huge chunks of the icing off. It looked pretty haphazard by the time I snuck away again. 

My parents soon found the remains of the cake. Since I'm diabetic, they didn't suspect that it was me who picked at the leftovers (I was usually a very well-behaved kid). They blamed it on our rather chubby cat, and promptly deemed it unacceptable for human consumption. It was a believable scenario because she had stolen human food in the past. Sadly, they threw the rest of the cake out.

I could never own up to it because I would have been in trouble for compromising my blood sugar levels, and for being greedy! My old cat never ratted me out for letting her take the blame, though. Thanks, Molly, R.I.P!



Edit: I'm a woman and this was the year 2000, before the medical technology we have now. Back then, I only checked my blood glucose at mealtimes so the crime wouldn't have been evident until the next morning, and that's only if I was honest about my blood glucose level! There was no such thing as sliding-scale dosage back then so eating more cake was very much a bad idea! Hence only being allowed a little bit.

Edit 2: it was sitting out on the kitchen table and hadn't been wrapped up and put away yet lol. It was butter icing which made the cat theory a bit more believable

I need a place to live, and I bought my house with my already taxed income. I have to pay sales tax and property tax on that.

Their whole point is that the government ***shouldn't*** collect funds for \[insert governmental function here\] against the will of the taxees.

The ""theft"" claimers didn't *consent* to pay taxes, yet if they don't the gov't will attempt to coerce them into paying taxes in ever-escalating steps until eventually they send some nice young men with guns to \[insert government-imposed consequence here\] them.

Taking a person's belongings from them against their will, especially with the threat of force/imprisonment, is theft by definition. Theft *for a good cause that benefits us all like roads or hospitals or schools* is still theft.

What the money is taken-without-consent *for*, and *who's* doing the taking-without-consent, is irrelevant to whether or not that process is theft.

My dad about murdered me with his look in the rearview mirror, and my mom nearly took my head off shoving a coloring book and crayons at me. But the officer said YES, so I obliged.

I burped the phrase ""put your hands up"" and got my dad out of a ticket because the cop about died laughing.

Reddit is similar, but it doesn't have the same small-community feel. You used to go to a website for a niche interest, and there was a little button in the corner that said ""Messageboard"". It was kind of like a little hidden subreddit that only fans of the original site would ever find or bother signing up for. You could actually meet people and make friends, because there were few enough users that you could remember user names and personalities.

Some of them had off-topic forums where the community could share whatever they wanted.

I made friends on some of these boards that I'm still in contact with 20 years later, long after the boards have gone offline.

So, a lot of people asking about lawsuits. Unfortunately, that was not an option.

142kyjh,jn6zubx,"I agree with the cause. I think Reddit is being greedy and unreasonable. Having said that, I doubt this protest will make a big difference.

The most likely outcome is that the executives don't care, or don't even notice.

Let's say that the best case scenario happens and it does make Reddit lower its prices or something. Even if that does happen, IMO it'll only delay the inevitable because the same people who came up with these ideas are still running Reddit. These are the same people who have knowingly continued to provide poor service to their platform, and in many cases made it worse, for the sake of profit. They have done this for years, and this new policy is an escalation of that behavior rather than the first sign of it. Any success Reddit has had in recent years have been in spite of its management, and thanks to volunteers and app developers who make things that make reddit usable. 

So even if they roll back their policies now, IMO these same people will find some other way to weasel crap into their service later. There's no stopping this trend without an overhaul at the top, and that's not likely to happen. 

That's why at this point, I think it's best to try to find a new place to move to instead of hoping the current place permanently changes its attitude for the better. Because this place has proven many times over that it's hostile to its users, and is unlikely to stop.",9

You take responsibility when you run a sub. Whatever. I hope tge majority stays reasonable and steady with the fight and things do turn around.

About 4 -5 months after my father was diagnosed, he became so ill that he couldn't even remember my name. I remember how horrible I felt. A couple days later I stole my father's credit card and car and went on a spending spree. I remember buying a bunch of new DVD's, a puppy, food, etc and ignoring my life the whole time. 
When my father died a month or two later I found out that his bank account was drained and that the payments on the house didn't go through, so my step mother lost me and our home and I spent 5 years in the system. 
I lived with the guilt and shame for 15 years until I made an effort one day to contact my step mother for old times sake. We never had a good relationship and it just got worse when my father died because of all the stress, loss, etc. I told her the story and she laughed. She told me that what I stole was so insignificant that they didn't even know for some time. My uncle, my father's brother, was the one who stole all the money. I only took a couple hundred dollars.
Throughout the years I never knew and even my uncle let me live with the pain even though he knew because I confessed to him when I was a boy and upset.

189tk88,kbtvs15,"My brother is a kazillionaire. I don't know how wealthy he is, but it's a lot of zeroes.

He owns multiple businesses, which he created from scratch. He treats all his employees VERY well. He takes good care of them and their families. They're extremely loyal and have stayed with him for many years. 

As others have mentioned, he is always ON. He is always looking for a new angle. He does business on his cellphone while riding a ski lift. But he does a great job of being in the moment. He can be horsing around with his grandkids, and then, in two minutes of slack time, checks his email and makes a huge business decision, before going back to his grandkids with gusto.

He lives in a beautiful home which, while luxurious and well-appointed, is modest by kazillionaire standards. He and his wife are gracious and generous hosts,  not to show off their property, but to make their guests feel welcome and comfortable. Their guests aren't just fellow kazillionaires, but cover the entire socioeconomic spectrum. 

He doesn't flaunt his wealth. He has an expensive hobby, and he takes his family on expensive vacations, but he doesn't make a big deal of either one. Plus, he invites his brothers on ski trips and such, and all we have to do is show up and have a good time with him. 

The best thing is that he's a silent philanthropist. He very quietly gives away buckets of money. He doesn't brag about it. He just does it. It goes to scout troops, churches, schools, international foundations, single mothers, and the list goes on. I've only found out about his giving indirectly, never from him.

1 - Vet bills for their animals. The example that most stands out in my mind is their last dog. He needed dialysis and no vet where we live could provide it. So they did their research and discovered that the best treatment in the country was available in London. A flat in Kew (I think, somewhere fairly central anyway) was rented for the six months the dog would need treatment for and my uncle would stay in it for one week a month while the dog had his treatment, then travel back home for the other three weeks. 

2 - Legal help. Neighbours being pains in the backside? Send in the solicitor. Trying to organise a purchase or sale and it’s taking too long? Pay the solicitor to fast track.

It is easy to forget the cost of things when money is meaningless. When a $500k Ferrari is the financial equivalent to a gallon of milk for most families, then spending $20k on a party that includes private chefs, a bar staff, etc. is nothing. 

What happened recently was that someone mentioned there were a bunch of kids in MS who were getting trained at trade schools for jobs, but the certification exam was $350 so only 2 kids out of the 35 in our pilot program got certified. It was hard for anyone in that room to understand how these families couldn't come up with $350 having a whole year to prepare. Most people in that room bill at $250-$500/hr. if they work at all. 

Two days ago, someone took me out to lunch and the bill was $250, but since it's Christmas season and the waitress was really great, he tipped $250.

A different time, we went out for drinks at the bartender was one of those ""tell me what you like and I'll make you something."" The lady goes to pay and just writes 'math' in the tip line and put $500 on the total for what was less than three drinks a person for four of us. 

On the other hand, there are lots of times when someone says something completely off the wall elitist. I grew up incredibly poor and some of these people are fifth and tenth generation wealth. They grew up with maids and butlers and private planes and their great grandparents have buildings all over the US named after them. 

One time one of them was talking about how she went to Walmart to people watch and never felt unsafe even though it was ""the black part of town."" She tried to ""make some black friends because if she could befriend them then she could educate them on better financial decisions."" It was such a condescending and racist approach we had to council her to never do that again. Another guy says things like ""the blacks will ___ "" and he thinks he's very woke.

That one is an outlier, but the underlying concept of unstoppable belief in oneself is a common thread. I spend all day wondering if I’m getting it right. I don’t think the people worth north of 10 million ever wondered about that at all.

Worth keeping in mind that isn’t sufficient — I know some big failures that also don’t question themselves. They’re just not good enough at anything for that to pay off.

As soon as I realized what I was making out I directed my full attention and it was back to photos of a car show. As they day went on I though nothing of it and proceeded continue my work until I was bringing another customers pc to the back to work on and again from my peripheral I could have sworn I saw a bloody body in bound in a trunk of a car. At that moment I began to freak out. I grabbed one of my employees explained to him the situation. We then sat for 10 minutes and watched this screen saver (It is against company policy to search through the clients personal files without absolute just cause.) We then proceeded to see a photo 2 bodies in a shallow grave out in the woods and another photo of a severed hand down in kitchen drawer. I then went and got the general manager and informed him of the situation and had him view this screen saver. We then felt that I would be in everyone's best interest to contact Law Enforcement. In about 15 minutes later owner of the computer and another gentleman show up I proceed to tell him that his computer is not ready and it will be awhile. He then informs me that he was called there because someone reported there was some photographs of a grisly murder that we had found. I showed him his computer and then his partner then begins to laugh at him.

12gb3fs,jflrxof,"The day after my dad died, I laid down and took a long nap. I was exhausted from the visitors and the questions and the reminders that he was gone, so I just wanted to escape for awhile. 

During that nap, I dreamt a strange dream. I was back in the hospital again and I saw my dad surrounded by doctors and hooked to all kinds of wires and IVs. I cried and told them to leave him alone and that he had suffered enough, but my dad told me not to cry, and it was then that I noticed they were actually removing the wires and IVs from him. He stood up, which was something he hadn’t done in a long time, and asked me to walk with him. 

He was wearing a long white robe and together we walked through a beautiful place next to a stream. I was telling him about how we had seen the Avengers recently and how his favorite superhero, The Hulk, had been in it. I laughed as I explained the scene where Hulk slams Loki around like a rag doll and said, “Oh my god. That would have been your favorite part. You would have died laughing.” My dad said, “Poor choice of words,” but he was smiling. I said, “Yeah, true. Sorry dad.”

His smile went away and then he looked at me seriously, and said, “It’s alright. You know, I didn’t really want to die.”

…and then I woke up. I had tears streaming down my face, and to this day I have never had another dream like that again. I’ve always been skeptical of the unknown but sometimes I wonder if he was saying goodbye to me in the only way he could. I still miss him every day of my life.

I kind of laughed and said “please don’t let my house have actually been broken into” out loud as I turned the corner onto my street. The first thing I noticed when I pulled up to the house were the blinds on my bedroom window. They were yanked around and twisted up. Some guy that lives across the street turned out to have been stalking me and decided to climb through my bedroom window. He took nothing valuable. Just some weird personal items. It was terrifying to walk in and see my things rummaged through. It was even scarier when I talked to the neighbor and they admitted that multiple people in the neighborhood had seen it happen, but they were all too scared of ol’ dude to say anything. The weirdest part of it all (and I mean this guy took some *creepy* personal things) is that nagging feeling I had before I found the remnants of the break in.

On one of those rare weekends, where a friend’s parents leave the house for the weekend, we were enjoying a rare treat of partying in comfort in a living room. We ran out of beer and snacks. My three companions went to the store around sundown. While alone in a dimly lit house, the phone rang. When I answered, a voice said in a slow, quiet whisper “…it’s allllll yourrrrr faullllt….”.  

What ran through my brain in an instant was how boring my life had been to this point, and this was probably the most exciting thing that has ever happened to me. Like something you see on TV or in the movies. And in a flash my excitement blurted out as “far OUT!!!!”. Then they hung up.",368

I call him and he texts back, everything is fine, he's doing great, but it doesn't calm my growing anxiety when I think of him.

Every puddle had these mushroom-like things in them. A fluffy top that was an off white and then 4 brown prong-like triangular flaps underneath to keep them floating on the surface of the puddles. When you poked the tops it let out air. There were so many of them. They were everywhere. The next day it was super sunny. The puddles were dried up and so were the shroom things. Shriveled up.

Edit: To everyone wondering why she would cry about a tire pressure light, I think that was second time the light came on in three months so she didn’t think it was safe or reliable anymore and traded it in soon after (I believe the next one was a Lexus).

147t9px,jnx3yp8,"One weekend, I was at my dads house. He’d come to the upstairs bathroom to get a shave and heard footsteps in my step-sisters room. I thought it was him walking around initially, so I got up to find him standing at her closed door. He looks back at me and whispers “you can hear that too, right..?” I nodded and he opened the door slowly. My step sister was asleep, and never had been awake apparently (there was no way she could have crossed the room, gotten in bed, and pretended to be THAT convincingly asleep in the 2 seconds it took my dad to open the door). He went in, checked her TV which had never been on (she had one of those big ones from the 90s that would get warm when turned on), the radio hadn’t been on either (figured maybe it was the beat of a song or something). After that, we heard the footsteps a bunch of times, usually very early in the morning. Some of the footsteps were so heavy, they’d shake the ceiling fan of the dining room directly under her bedroom and they’d woken her up a few times as well 

Whenever I’d shower at my dads, I always felt like someone was standing behind me. Eventually, I got so stressed and paranoid that I refused to shower at the house or even go into the upstairs bathroom. My dad asked me one day “do you ever feel like someone’s in the shower with you when you’re here?” After months of me feeling that way and never mentioning it to anyone",9845

There are tons of stories but the one I experienced myself was when I was living there as a child. I was about 6 yo and my older sister was 12 and we shared a room. My mom had decorated our bedside table with an antique telephone that didn’t work and was not plugged in. My sister and I were asleep and for some reason we both woke up at the same time and turned to face each other. I remember feeling an extreme feeling of dread. Then the phone rang in between us. We locked eyes and both hid under our blankets til it stopped ringing. We both thought it was a dream because we didn’t say anything for years about it, then one day she was talking about it and we realized we had had the exact same experience.

Camping at a friend's family property with a group of friends. They had a huge dingy shop full of old tools and old furniture that was super creepy. Dirt floor, clown paintings in the loft (not even kidding). We stayed up late drinking by the fire and I was the last one awake. Went to go pee on the side of the shop and stood about 5 feet away looking inside through the window. There was a florescent light on and I noticed what looked like a piece of paper or dollar kind of floating around. I thought it was a moth at first but it was moving in a very flowing figure 8 pattern that was very rhythmic. It reminded me of dangling a carrot. I watched it for maybe 20 seconds, which felt like forever. Then it quickly floated back to the corner of the shop where it was dark. There was also a wood chair near the corner that added to the creepiness. Could have been a moth though.

I sat back down by the fire to finish my beer and have a smoke. No one else was awake so I played robot unicorn attack 2 on my phone for a while. I noticed my friend Mark pop out of his tent to pee, then go back in to go to sleep. I decided sleep sounded good, so I went to my tent and fell asleep. The next morning, we were having breakfast and Mark said,"" I saw you guys sitting by the fire super late, how late did you stay up?"" I told him I was probably 2 or 3 am. Then he said,"" who was up with you?"" I told him I was the last man standing. He said,"" I got up to pee and saw you on your phone and 2 people over you're shoulder watching you play"". He said one person looked bigger so he thought it was one of our friends, who was a bigger dude. He said the other person was taller and skinny, but none of us are noticeably tall, or skinny .

I'd traced a line back to Boston in the 19th century and was working on a woman and her family who lived there when I got a distinct notion in my head that I was to SIT UP, STOP EATING, and TREAT HER FAMILY WITH THE PROPER RESPECT!

I'm a bit of a slob so I was slouching and working on a bag of chips while I browsed through and tried to connect records.  I got the distinct impression that this lady didn't like how casually I was handling HER FAMILY.  lol

Also a couple years back I was mourning the death of my brother who died of complications from his diabetes.  I was chatting with a friend and got this complete thought in my head from a person I'd never met in life -- my grandfather who had the same name as my brother.  He said that he'd met my brother at the gate and that ""we're going fishing!""

Which when I told mom this she said that's EXACTLY how her dad would try to spend time and get to know someone.  Outdoors, on the water, swatting black flies and telling stories.

It's not like having an actual conversation when I receive these impressions -- it's more like getting a text message inserted directly into my brain.

Every so often, she pops up in my brain, but objective thinking more than emotional attachment. I've been with my current partner for 4.5 years, and having someone else you love helps forget too.

I think because I'm a guy in our family, if you talk about emotions, it's considered a weakness. Therefore, I didn't know how to process emotions. Thus, it took longer to get over.

Often with relationships, I've seen women cry immediately when they break up. Guys are stoic and super proud about it, like it doesn't bother them. Months down the line, the women have moved on, and they're fine. The guy is upset and misses his partner, this can go on for years; he tries to get over it with distractions/ hobbies, but that never truly works, they just think it does, you could say it's a sticking plaster.

Why is this? Emotional processing. Most guys don't have a clue how to do this. The quicker you process emotions, the quicker it goes away.

The way my therapist describes this is as a type of grief - it _feels_ like you lost that future person. But in reality, you simply came to the realization that your vision of the future was incorrect.

But the truth is, that happens to us all of the time. We imagine a future that won’t happen, and we adjust over time. This one is emotionally complicated, but much the same in it’s core nature.

1. Smell

2. Both intelligence and stupidity of ppl

4. Actual military firepower and the vast ability to wipe out areas if wanted to (tbh, this would be a much easier virus to contain vs something like COVID. You can actually “kill” this virus with air strikes or even just bullets. You can’t do that with traditional virus and disease)

Edit: this concept of “nobody is trained for headshots” is not an answer to any of these points. Bones, muscle and tissue simply cannot operate when they are damaged. Trauma from weapons (whether they are explosive, projectile, blunt force, etc) can immobilize and render motor functions useless. When you shoot the legs and knees of a horde of zombies, yeah they aren’t “dead” but they are significantly less mobile and less of a threat which allows more lethal finishes significantly easier.

So I told them, I never planned with that money as it is m gym membership and I am happy to support the ppl and the company to go through this time. They paid their employees as they stated. Great, I was happy.

In the second lockdown they did the same thing but without stating any support for their employees. I explicitly asked and they replied that their employees would also be happy to have an employer they could come back to after COVID. Well yes, but this felt wrong. As all their worker were on an hourly basis they could just stop paying them. And they did.

However, as I wanted to quit asap, I chose continue anyway as pause would just extend the time period. Got me a new gym after COVID.",85

This one borders on legend/myth as the only people who can confirm it even exists have kept it in secret in the vaults of the Vatican.  And if they do exist they would be 1700 years old.  The First Council of Nicaea is commonly known as the first ecumenical council that created the first known uniform Christian doctrine.  Most people familiar with this know what came from it was the accepted origins of Christ, the date and celebration of Easter, and the establishing of canon law.  One significant thing missing is the discussion of accepted gospels to later become The New Testament.  In fact there is no known existing record of any discussion of biblical canon at the First Council.  Kind of a huge omission from history.

What is mostly not known are the parts they decided to leave out and their reasons for doing so.  The only known dissenting opinion on record at the First Council was Arius’ claim that Jesus was created out of nothing, not begotten, born from a mortal womb. One of the main reasons in having the First Council was to declare this as heresy.  

The only official document released to the general public was the Nicene Creed, but this is the finished product.  It’s presented as though they created the final product as they went along.  Historians agree it’s extremely likely several scribes were taking minutes of the meetings that were later organized into the final creed.  (Which itself was revised of course for decades later.)  

The theory is Emperor Constantine kept the minutes in the ecumenical archives of Constantinople, or kept them in Rome, either way later to be locked away in the vaults of the Vatican.",96

We know this because of a couple of interesting incidents.

Two former prime ministers have in interviews openly talked about the existence and location of these weapons. The public prosecutor looked into whether this counts as revealing state secrets or ignoring civil servant secrecy. It was decided not to pursue it as they could only prosecute if they officially confirmed that what the prime ministers said was true and supposed to be secret. Interpret this however you want.",19
18at7xp,kc2mxip,"The letters of last resort are always kept secret and then destroyed without being opened (well, so far...)

The new prime minister of the UK has to write letters to the captains of each of the four submarines in the Trident programme. At least one of the submarines is always out at sea meaning the nuclear deterrent is always hidden out in the depths of the ocean somewhere. 

The prime minister has to write the ""letters of last resort"" which give instructions for what to do if the British government is taken out by a nuclear strike. The suggested options for the incoming prime minister before writing the letters are usually - retaliate with nuclear weapons, don't retaliate, leave it to the captain's judgement, hand over control of the vessel to an allied country - usually listed as ""The United States if it's still there"" or ""go to Australia"".

Apparently Tony Blair's face was completely white when he left the office after having written the letters. The letters are then stored in a secure safe on the submarines till a new Prime Minister is sworn in at which point they're destroyed, unopened.

One of the signs that the submarine at sea uses to see if the UK has fallen is by checking if Radio 4 is still broadcasting. Apparently a few years ago when Radio 4 went down they were on a higher level of alert till they confirmed that the UK was still standing.",39

I left the President blank in 2020. 

I will be voting against Trump --even if it means voting for a D-- in 2024.

Why... Trump promised to end the deficit. Instead he increased it in his first budget. 

Trump promised to limit government power. Instead he tried to increase the power of the President. 

Plus his moral failings. 

Then, after the election, he spread lies about Democracy, and led the insurrection. 

Trump is a hardcore bad guy in the story of American Democracy and American freedom. 

I am glad Trump happened. It forced me to examine the Republican Party. I was able to realize that there are good and moral and ethical Democrats. Just like there are a small number of Republicans who are good and ethical humans. 

I still support gun rights.

But I want abortion to be safe, legal, and rare. The ramifications are a woman having to report a miscarriage when abortion isn't legal. Thats not a small-government limited-government ideal. 

But now I can see that we need to worry about the environment, civil rights, and police have way, way too much power. 

If a patient dies on a doctors table, with the doctor trying to save the patient, the doctor is investigated and can lose their license. A police officer kills a suspect through obvious error, and nothing happens. That can't all work like that if our democracy is going to work. Police in the US has far far too much power. 

Trump had stacks of Police guarding the white house during BLM in 2020. But none when the House and Senate were to ratify the 2020 election. That is an obvious statement on Trumps part. When -Trump- feared armed police were stacked deep. With Democracy on the line, Trump limited the police.",691

For a lot of faiths, in particular in Catholic doctrine (though I believe Islam has a similar mindset), sex is not a bad thing, **however** sex has a specific use and purpose. It is done explicitly with your spouse, and primarily for the purposes of having children. (I’m sure there are nuances involving the intimacy of a spousal relationship and sex deepening that bind but I’m less familiar with that bit.)

As a result, these faiths are very kid-positive. So therefore in addition to the beliefs that an egg could count as human life (and therefore birth control can fall in a similar jurisdiction as abortions), and using contraceptives can be seen as denying that purpose to sex.

Now there are complexities to that and pragmatism and given that not many people are having 8 kids anymore, I suspect it’s not **tightly** followed. But if you want an academic, genuine reasoning, that’s the reason.",555

I loved the bookmobiles that would visit my street, and I must have read every biography (all bound in blue covers) in my elementary school library.  It was a different era with many fewer distractions and much more time for sustained imagination.  Being a different place and time, we developed different skills for interacting with the world and each other than young people do today.  Was it better?  That's hard to say.  We tended to have an insular view of our own little world, while today it is hard to escape what it happening everywhere on Earth.

Everyone else goes in front of me except for one friend I already met, whose telling me to try a flip. I’m hesitant but yanno what, I think I can do it. 

I run at the diving board, with all 8 of my girlfriends friends watching me from the pool, jump and explode with all my might. One thing they don’t tell you about the high five is that the board is much looser than a normal diving board. I pushed off with my legs when I would expect a normal diving board to stop descending, but the high dive was still only maybe halfway on its way down. My legs push down on air, the board comes up, throws me off, all while I’m trying to prepare for a flip. I do a one and a half rotation, slamming my face into the water harder than I’ve ever hit anything. Pretty sure my eyeball was bleeding.

I was so desperate for friends that I leaned into it and used to brag about my test scores or say things about me being smart.

If you are reading this then you know that that did not go well... And it did quite the opposite of making me cool and instead made people resent me or make fun of me.

Thankfully, I was able to develop friendships after that, but I always had the stigma of being a smart kid and people were always mad when I did well on tests, but I stopped the egotistical bragging and just stayed humble, which turns out to be a cooler way to act.",500

For decades, dietary fat has been vilified as the main culprit behind weight gain and health problems. Low-fat diets were promoted as the key to good health, and many people began to fear fat in all its forms. However, recent research has shown that not all fats are created equal, and that some types of fat are actually essential for optimal health. 

Here's why eating fat can be healthy, despite common beliefs:

Essential for brain function: Our brains are largely composed of fat, and we need adequate amounts of healthy fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids, for proper brain function. These fats are crucial for memory, learning, and mood regulation.

Helps with nutrient absorption: Many important vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, are fat-soluble, meaning they require fat to be properly absorbed by the body. Eating a diet too low in fat can lead to deficiencies in these essential nutrients.

Promotes satiety and weight management: Contrary to popular belief, eating fat can actually help with weight management. Fat is more satiating than carbohydrates, meaning it helps you feel full and satisfied for longer periods. This can lead to reduced overall calorie intake and better weight control.

Supports heart health: While trans fats and some saturated fats can be harmful to heart health, other types of fat, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, can actually support heart health. These healthy fats help reduce inflammation, improve cholesterol levels, and decrease the risk of heart disease.

It's important to note that not all fats are healthy, and it's still crucial to choose the right types of fat and consume them in moderation. Healthy fat sources include avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish like salmon. By incorporating these healthy fats into our diets and letting go of the fear of all dietary fat, we can support our overall health and well-being.",68

As you know, in 1919, the manufacture, sale and transportation of alcohol was prohibited. But instead of plummeting, alcohol sales soared. Speakeasies opened everywhere, and as a result, people in some neighborhoods were drinking even more than before. The mafias got in on the act, stealing large quantities of industrial alcohol.

In 1926, the authorities resorted to the hard way, asking manufacturers to add toxic substances to their alcohol (adding ten times more methanol, for example). In New York alone, 1,200 drinkers were poisoned and 400 died. A wave of deaths would eventually sweep across the country. This ""poisoning policy"" was not stopped until December 1933.",1881

When a person going through some difficult stuff is less friendly and cheerful around you than they are around other people, it can make you feel defensive.

It's really counterintuitive.

If the person is like this all the time that's not a green flag, that's a straight up red flag. And if they are verbally or otherwise abusive that's also a red flag.

This Tree Ent we shall call ""Rejjie"". Rejjie cares for all trees and their sapnutbabies. Once the babies are freed they are paired with wildlife to be taught survival skills. 

Benefits:

1) Dad's and Mom's finish together.  
2) Mom's don't have to endure child birth.  
3) We will definitely plant more trees which is an overall win.  
4) SNB will be born with an orange glow to their skin. This will be called the Amber Aura.

16voaud,k2sdmt9,"I'm 40, I don't have kids.

4 years ago I moved to a new place and befriended my neighbour, he has 1 daughter from a previous relationship, his girlfriend has 2 more (also from a previous relationship).

They both used to work shifts, so they needed a babysitter for the two daughters of his gf, the other girl would go to her mom's place, as she lives really close.

One year ago,  they couldn't find a babysitter for 3 days, and I had to pick up these 2 girls ( 5 and 8 years old at the time), from school, help them with homework, have them shower, make them dinner and then put them to bed.

They already knew me of course as I often hang out with their mother and my neighbour, but I've never kept them alone.

I had the best of times. They were a blast. Lovely, kind, would not talk back or make a scene.

Nowadays they're 7 and 9(nearly 10). I often go to their place and the youngest gives me the biggest hugs, then just sit on my lap while the oldest just sit next to me, and both will tell me about their day and talk about random stuff. We do lots of activity together and I'm now more like an uncle than just the neighbour. And I love it. I feel loved, I feel appreciated, It just feels... nice.

That feeling there, is what is lost when you don't have a kid. I think it's surely the only ""pro"" of having a kid.

Editing because of many comments: The goal is NOT to compare ""parenting"" and ""being an uncle"".  OF COURSE being a parent is different and has many downsides. THAT. IS. NOT. THE. POINT. OF. THE. POST.

The point is:

""what's the con of not having kids? ""> ""the con is that you may miss of these good feelings kids give you when you take care of them""

He was born to a wealthy Parisian family in 1848. His father owned a textile business that he later inherited. He was an artist in his own right, but became much more known as a supporter of the arts. Fearful he'd die young, he writes in his will that the French state accept his large art collection (today valued at several billion dollars) and hang art from several impressionist artists, who were friends of his, in a national museum upon his death.

Caillebotte dies young (45) in 1894 as he predicted and so his will attempts to be executed. The French government initially refuses the request. Pundits and critics, from art to politics, view the request as absurd and publicly say how repulsed they are by the collection itself. Several art professors from Ecole des Beaux-Arts threaten to resign if the government enacts the will.

In the end, half of Caillebotte's art collection gets hung in 1897 at the Musee du Luxemborg and the public comes out in droves to visit the gallery because of all the press Caillebotte's request had received after his death. People wanted to see this ""ugly art.""

The artists featured? Their names were Monet, Renoir, Degas, Cezanne, Manet, Pissarro, and Sisley.

It's very possible these artists would never have become the household names they are today had Caillebotte not liked the ugly, unsellable art that a few of these friends of his made.",2422

An ER doc was running some baby docs through training when a disheveled man in an old rumpled suit, obviously homeless, came in complaining of nonspecific malaise. Kept mumbling about quantum whatever under his breath. Wasn't all there, mentally.

She thought he was drug seeking, but opted to run him through basic diagnostics to show the baby docs how it was done. Turns out the dude was in full blown kidney failure. They put him on dialysis and he just *snaps* into focus. Complete turnaround, 100% coherent.

Turns out dude was an actual professor and expert on quantum mechanics and was riding a train to a conference when he entered kidney failure. It addled his brain and he wandered off the train at a random stop in a state of confusion. He'd been roaming the streets for months like that. Somehow didn't die.

Of course, they tore my car apart and found absolutely nothing as I don’t do drugs, drink, or take any medications beyond the occasional multivitamin. I’m in law enforcement and know that many, MANY police officers train in a backdoor signal to drug K9s that manufacture probable cause to search. They might tap a couple of times or say a code word and the dog will “hit” whenever they do. Nothing ever came of the stop, after 6 cruisers, 8 officers, and a K9. All because I refused a search and politely refused to answer any questions. After the stop was over I was issued a warning for 37 in a 35.

He ran out of the store just being an idiot and got in my truck. There was a police car behind me. Police car followed me out of the parking lot and immediately pulled me over.

He asked if he could search my truck. My truck was a tiny 2-seater; if we'd stole anything, there was no place to hide it. I said for what reason? He just asked to search it again, and I said no. He could see that my buddy was still wearing his work clothes.  Cop came back and gave me a ticket for having a clear license plate cover (they were legal at the time), but said it was cloudy and obstructing my plate. Obviously looking for something to punish me for.

So a guy named Gray Horsefield (great name) took home a workstation over the 2002 holiday break and re-animated the entire tower collapse himself so it didn't look so depressingly familiar.

I bought some dumb bells, kettle bells and resistance bands. 

I didnt focus on my diet at first just limited the quantity and chewed my food thoroughly to help with digestion. This will get better as you become more serious about weight loss however that comes with time. 

Whenever I would watch TV I would be using dumb bells, kettle bells, resistance bands, calistethics rather than just sit there and that adds up and gets easier over time. 

Cut out soda and just left it to tea, coffee, water, juice. 

I made myself run, or get on the eliptical. I would go slow at first, focusing on my breathing and core then the more I got used to it the faster I got and the more i craved it.

Having a steady schedule is what will really make a huge difference. Going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time. The structure and stability is good for the body. 

This is what helped me lose weight time and time again, before and after I had my son. 

Taking care of yourself is a lifetime commitment. It's not clothes you're going to be using a couple of times then throwing away when it gets worn down. It's your body and loving yourself more than your addictions. 

Figure out what works for you and just do it. You're going to mess up and that's ok just as long as you dont stop. Your discipline will get better over time the more you work at it.

17vrtur,k9db9tl,"It’s no secret.

Smoking is responsible for the highest number of preventable deaths.

Beyond that, it also lowers your quality of life badly. It increases your risk of a host of diseases  and complicates many many others. 
Aside from lung cancer, it aggravates the risk of cervix, colon, skin, esophagus, larynx, liver, mouth and throat, pancreatic, stomach, and leukemia cancers.

It’s awful for your risk of stroke, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. It accelerates bone breakdown. It can weaken your immune system and increase your risk of infection. It can aggravate auto immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

And, of course, it just beats the hell out of your lungs. COPD can reduce your quality of life to nearly nothing. You wind up wheelchair bound, dragging an oxygen tank around, and essentially leaving the house only to check into the hospital every few weeks for a severe exacerbation.

It is also known to cause type 2 diabetes, and all the crap that entails.

Vascular disease means poor wound healing, even in the absence of diabetes; impotence; activity intolerance; blindness, etc.

And most of these risks are observable at levels as low as a quarter pack (5 cigarettes) daily.

Studying as a healthcare professional goes something like this: ""oh this illness? who has a predisposition for it? you'll never guess!""

1b287x9,kskt5w8,"I almost didn’t comment because this is isn‘t a very common thing to run across—then I realized that rationale is at the root of what makes it so difficult to relate to.  Some of you have probably heard of the Troubled Teen Industry (TTI).  In a nutshell, thousands of children are sent against their will to abusive facilities because their parents believe they require behavioral adjustments.  These facilities go by varied ideologies boot camps, behavior modification facilities, wilderness therapy, drug rehab (this is just a cover…even if you’ve never done drugs they’ll accept the child under the false pretense they are saving them from “future behavior”.  However, they’re all marketed to parents, who are often the root of the family’s problem, as a miracle cure which will ensure an obedient outcome.  I was tricked into visiting one of these programs by my mother when I was 14.  I was far from a bad kid, I was simply an unwanted leftover from a precious marriage who was unloved and made the family scapegoat.  The reason I’m responding to the thread’s question is that the idea can be so foreign to some that they cannot even wrap their heads around the concept.  Especially so if they’ve grown up in a loving environment.  I was subjected to physical, mental and sexual abuse while I was held for 2 years in a warehouse located in an industrial park outside a large metropolis.  One of the most evil aspects was In order for you to advance in the program and hopefully leave it one day was you were expected to inflict these indignities on the other children.  It not only victimizes children, it instills them with a deep shame.  It also makes support group participation that much more difficult because your fellow captives are also your abusers.

 I hope you’ll forgive the length of this post.  Ironically, the need for a long intro is at the center of what I’m wanting to communicate though—I could literally explain what the experience was like for 2 weeks straight, and I’d probably only scratch the surface of what its like to loose all of your rights and freedoms, to be subjected to brainwashin, tortured at the whim of the programs facilitators and other children/captives, to live in constant fear all day, every day for years without hope of escape.  I denied it all happened until I was in my forties.  I’ve learned to be very selective about who I share the topic with because people, without meaning to, can respond in ways which can be triggering,  I think think this also speaks to the spirit of this thread:  how can they be expected to respond if they are likely unaware of what the experience was really like, or might be completely unaware that it’s even happening at all in the US today?

Freddie Mercury did not leave the band to make a solo record while under the bad influence of some gay Svengali only to get diagnosed with AIDS and get back together with the boys for their stellar Live Aid performance. 

The band never broke up before Live Aid. In fact I know someone who seen them tour a couple of months before Live Aid. He wasn't even the first guy in the band to have a solo record.

We used to rent games together at a game place when we were teens. I went in one day without Bob and the guy(Mike owns and runs it) says the account is under Bob. If you're the other guy you'll have to set up another account. He asked ""you're Bob , aren't you?"" 


I said yes(small white lie) got the game to rent and told Bob the story later.


We spent the next few years talking to the owner all the time and the owner saying goodbye Bob to me. The place closes down and the lie ends there(yay, it had gone on for too long)


4 years later, I'm married and we go and pick up something from an electronic store. And there's Mike, he runs over and shakes me hand and says ""How's life Bob "". He tells one of his employees that I kept his store alive with all the games me and my mate bought and rented. He complained to misses Bob, where was his invite to the wedding. He gave me and my confused wife a 20% discount and we went on our way. 


10 years later, I needed a computer piece, I took my 2 & 4 year old kids with me and went to computer parts store. And low and behold, there was mike, he says long time no see Bob. My kids are confused but are shy, so they are quiet. Mike gives me a free upgrade on the hard drive I was buying. 


As we are leaving, I'm holding my 2 year old and she exclaims quite loudly


""His name is not Bob!"" I freeze and feel sick, time slows down. 


Then she says ""His name is Dad"" 


Mike and his work friend laughed and I made my exit.

- Twin Lakes

- Dogtown (in Guernsey County, I don’t know what it’s actually called)

My great aunt and her family used to live in Xenia, which is the setting for the movie Gummo. I’d say it’s about medium accurate.

The absolute weirdest one to me is Holloway. It’s a tiny, and I mean tiny, town/village by where I grew up. You can stand on a hill and overlook the whole thing, it’s so crammed together. The tiny streets still have badly rusted white signs, the houses all look pre-1900 with few signs of updating, and overall it looks completely abandoned, except people still definitely live there. There’s a post office and what appeared to be a functioning bar. 

Every time we drove through Holloway, anyone on the street (never more than a single person at a time) would stare directly at us, angrily, like we should be fully aware we aren’t welcome there.

His obsessive search for the truth leads to a groundbreaking discovery: law enforcement used a secret technology called a Stingray to intercept his phone calls and personal information, as well as those of millions of unsuspecting Americans. He takes his discovery public, and the revelation not only carries implications for his case, but also for the fate of the Fourth Amendment.

The stingrays are cell site simulators"" or ""IMSI catchers,""  invasive cell phone surveillance devices that mimic cell phone towers and send out signals to trick cell phones in the area into transmitting their locations and identifying information. When used to track a suspect's cell phone, they also gather information about the phones of countless bystanders who happen to be nearby, as a law enforcement can literally drive down any block with one turned on, having it connect to every single mobile device as it moves down the street.

He got his manifesto published, and used the phrase ""eat your cake and still have it"" rather than the more commonly-known version. His brother David just so happened to read that manifesto and remember how Ted used that phrase. David decides, on a lark, to go through some of the stuff Ted had left at their mom's house and finds an early draft of the manifesto.

Anything at all in that chain doesn't happen, Ted uses a different phrase, David doesn't read the manifesto or doesn't bother investigating Ted's old stuff, or Ted doesn't leave the draft in Mom's house, or David doesn't tell the FBI, or the FBI toss the lead entirely, and The Unabomber probably stays active to this day.",318

They almost even got away with it the second time because a guard didn't think anything of tampered locks.  It was only after the guard noticed the locks tampered again that he called the cops.

Even then they would have got away with it if it wasn't for the spotter (who was supposed to watch for cops) getting distracted by watching TV instead.

Even then they would have got away with it if the cop car that attended was a regular cop car with lights and sirens, the spotter would have noticed that much, but it didn't because the cops on duty were drunk at a bar and made an excuse about the car being out of fuel, so what attended were undercover guys in an unmarked car.

Even then there would have been no connection back to Nixon if it wasn't for the burglars taking an address book of incriminating names / phone numbers with them to the Watergate Hotel.

18w1wvg,kfwxrpm,"Murderer John List

In 1971, he murdered his wife, mother, and three children in their home in Westfield, New Jersey. After killing them, he meticulously planned to cover his tracks. He canceled all deliveries, notified the children's schools that the family would be visiting a sick relative out of town, and even reached out to friends and family to explain their long absence. 

He also cleaned the crime scenes, cut himself out of the family photos (I'm guessing not to be ID'd, like friends and neighbors wouldn't mention him, Idk), and left religious music playing on the house’s intercom system.

Although he evaded arrest for almost 2 decades, he had a knack for only planning things as thoroughly as the movies do. He parked his car at JFK airport, to make the cops think he fled via plane but they checked the manifestos and determined he never boarded. 

He was ultimately found when a former neighbor reported that age-progressed clay bust featured on ""America’s Most Wanted"" looked like Robert Clark, John's new identity. 

Anyway, he was convicted in 1990 to 5 life sentences.

My wage is the same as the wage of the supervisor role they want me to take. Inconceivable.

EDIT: Since this is getting quite a few comments, I will address some of the questions that appear the most.

I work in IT (specifically IT networking and am currently a NOC tech for those that care for details). 

My current job is as a contractor for a U.S. Federal agency (it's not the one you are thinking of...no not that one either, stop guessing). On top of that, I'm a sub-contractor, so I get paid more than my co-workers (I don't why it's like that). 

Wages are capped based on the contract with the government, and while these companies do not tell the employees what the cap is (because they can, and do, pay below the cap and keep the difference), we can sometimes figure out where the cap is. I know I'm currently at my wage cap which also happens to be the same (slightly less) than the cap of the supervisor role.

Why not take the role for my resume and get a better job in a year? I did 10 years in the military and was a supervisor for some of that time. I was miserable. Can I be a good supervisor, sure. Do I like being a supervisor, no.  Also, in IT, a person can focus on being a technician and continue up that path in a career and never move into management (my current plan) and make a decent living.",12116

Technically I could throw your application away, I usually won't unless you're especially obnoxious about it but it definitely does not help.

For example, “giving birth naturally.”   Some people seem to think that before modern obstetrics, that we were all just a bunch of natural goddesses giving birth in the forest.  But the reality was a lot more grotesque than that.  If everyone gave birth the way we did in 1900, we would be seeing a lot more childbirth related death.  We would also see a lot more women dealing with fistulas, and being ostracized 

Same with vaccines.  Letting “nature” take its course, killed us, sometimes at alarming rates (like with smallpox).  Oh sure, they had natural immunity to a lot of things, just like we develop natural immunity to a lot of things - except some immunities are a lot safer to get naturally.

Discounting that the Eastern Roman Empire was still around and would in fact last another 1000 years, much of Western Europe was in at least decent shape. The ""Barbarian"" groups that took over Western Roman territory made sure to preserve as much of the Imperial infrastructure as they could, many Roman aristocrats still had influence in the provinces and had no problem helping their new overlords.

Yes, somethings were lost, but it was hardly the backwards dung heap that it was so often depicted as. The only place that you could even say was dark post-empire was Britian and that was due to it falling early, a great deal of the infrastructure falling apart and just our lack of knowledge of what happened between the Roman withdrawal and the establishment of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms.",22

In fact, the Medieval church was one of the only places in Europe keeping knowledge alive, as monks transcribed and copied ancient sources.

18kh8xb,kdsai6q,"As a history teacher there are dozens of extremely common misconceptions (and outright propaganda) that I must address with my students. But the most common misconception I have to dispel every year is the common belief that humans before modern medicine had a life expectancy of 30 years or so. That is technically true but ONLY if you include infant and child mortality. If a person made it to 13 or so, they could reasonably expect to live a relatively healthy life into their 60s or early 70s. 

You’d be shocked by the number of people, including adults, think that it was totally normal for someone from the Middle Ages to just keel over at 25-30. Ridiculous!

Modern medicine, consistent access to food, and clean water HAS done wonders for keeping children alive until young adulthood, and to a lesser extent keeping people alive in their later years or stopping the odd lethal illness from killing a healthy person in their prime.",39

There have been multiple studies showing no evidence of adverse health effects from MSG. There is a subset of people that report hypersensitivity to it. But in double blind experiments, their symptoms tend not to show up when they don’t know they’ve eaten it. Conversely there symptoms DO show up when they think they’ve eaten it but haven’t actually.

Conclusion: MSG is literally just salt and glutamate protein, which is separately in just about everything you eat anyway.

It was a very long time ago (20 years!!! Damn, where did the time go?) but it is seared into my brain. They were perfect on paper, were fun to be around on the surface and had the sexiest car… and then our second date, they were rude to the server. Like, over the top rude and insulting. Snapped at the woman serving us, and when she smiled and put on a brave face, my date demanded loudly to know who had wasted their time training her and why we’d been sitting for five minutes and didn’t have water and bread yet. I was so shocked that at first I just sat there with my mouth open. It’s one of my biggest shames that I didn’t immediately stand up, tell the person off, apologize to the staff, and walk out. But I was very young, and very shocked, and I froze. After my date got done abusing the server and she left the table, I told them I felt sick to my stomach and needed to go to the restroom. I gave the host 20 dollars to give to our server and asked him to apologize to her on my behalf. I then spent 10 minutes staring at myself in the mirror and  regretting the fact that I hadn’t brought my nifty new little Nokia brick of a phone with me and that I’d have to ride home with this person (no Uber in those days, and no way for me to afford a 45 minute taxi ride in that particular location). Went back to the table and told my date I was so sorry, but I threw up in the bathroom and we needed to go. They knew I wasn’t really ill, I mean, I’ve never really had a poker face, and they must’ve been able to tell how appalled I was. So they stood up and we went to their car and had the most uncomfortable 45 minute car ride of my life. They never called me again, I certainly never called them again, and we just kind of pretended like we didn’t see each other anytime our paths crossed for the next two years while we lived in close proximity to one another.",392

So I'd have to bring him a bucket so he could puke in bed...and then I'd have to stay awake  (And then sleep on the couch) to make sure he didn't choke on his own vomit in his sleep.

He came home, in his twenties, from the army I think. I don't remember much about him, but he asked about taking my older brothers camping, but my mom said no, she had a weird feeling about him. (Side note, we lived out in in the country, not even a town, just a place). There were no locked doors, everyone trusted each other.

 My mom saw him at our little store with bee stings all over and was concerned . He said he got them at the creek. She thought that was weird, because that's just not a thing where we went all the time, but okay? 

A little while later (not sure how long), the news said there was a murder of some campers out past where we lived, no leads. People were shocked - this doesn't happen here!  My mom remembered her weird feeling and the bee stings that didn't make sense. She called the police to say, hey, probably nothing, but here's what I got. I remember detectives coming to our house to talk to her. 

They had some other evidence that matched, but not enough to link him to the murder (a couple with their child). It's unsolved to this day, though the detective said he knew it was him.

One of my mates remained sober to drive us back home. We went to the parking lot and I could hear a voice whimmering somewhere in the dark. I turned around and saw 2 guys carrying a girl to a car. I got closer and now I could hear her voice. She obviously was drunk but she repeated ,,no,, and ,,I don't want,, over and over. Adrenaline kicked in and I became sober instantly. I screamed at them and immediately called the police. I wasn't fast enough so they could get in the car and drive off. But I saw the license plate, gave it to the woman I talked to at the police station and they informed me about 10 minutes later that they arrested the two guys. The whole scene was so terrifying.

The only way to see if anyone is in the basement is through this small window in my bedroom that’s about 5 feet from my bed.
I got word while I was out that my place had been robbed. The robbers went through the basement suite door through the back, kicked it open, then made themselves upstairs after robbing the basement suite.
They just so happened to rob the place in a 30 minute window when myself, my brother and the people upstairs were out. This means they were watching us for a couple days and monitoring our patterns.

In many Western cultures, being outgoing, sociable, and outspoken is often celebrated and encouraged. It's seen as the norm to want to chat, network, and be the life of the party. But when it comes to introverts who may crave quiet, solitude, or just less social interaction, the script flips.

It’s socially acceptable to nudge the quiet person in the room and say, ""Why don't you talk more?"" But imagine telling a chatty person, ""Can you be quiet for a bit?"" It would be considered rude or offensive.

This double standard underscores a deeper societal bias towards extroversion. The noise and buzz of constant interaction are often valued more than the quiet, reflective spaces introverts thrive in. It's like we're saying one way of interacting with the world is better than the other, when in reality, both have their strengths and should be equally respected.

Not a raging 'get rid of him' kind of chat.

He never recognizes my mother. He wouldn’t survive a week without her, yet he treats her like she’s stupid.

That actually initiated a lot of my alcohol and drug overuse and sexual escapades that she is aware of.  But, I will not share that with her.

He then goes before the general, who is a bit disturbed, asking why his commander would do this. The commander says that it is part of his plan, and he knew that the general wouldn’t be on board with it if he asked first.

The commander then informs the general that he will go before the king of the enemy city, and claim that the general did this to him, and that he would like to betray said general for this mutilation. The commander then told the general to send his weakest men to a specific place so that the commander, leading the enemy forces could win a “major victory” solidifying his place with the enemy city. 

The commander would then take over watch of one of the gates, and simply let in the general’s army.

I met her at the gym - I was doing a really intense baseball training workout on the indoor turf field and there was this spectacularly fit, beautiful woman working out hard too. I walked over to talk with her and had a great conversation before we went back to our workouts. Later on she was in the very busy free weights area and I walked up to ask her out - it was one of those moments where you are suddenly aware that everyone is staring at you and you don't know why. 

I had absolutely no idea who she was and the weekend before our first date she flew to a fitness event; when I texted her she said ""I was busy signing autographs"". I still had no clue and said, well ok, ""I hope your hand doesn't get too tired."" She laughed at that, and later on I realized she wasn't kidding.

Our dating was amazing, and she was incredibly sweet, kind of country, and totally feminine. Unfortunately it was the time in my life where I had the biggest amount of work stress imaginable and it didn't work out, I just didn't have it together.

Cousin is actually quite a handsome guy, but it’s his freaking personality that’s driving women away.

Unsurprisingly, he gets ghosted a lot and can’t understand why. Sometimes the women do send him a polite text saying he’s a great guy but she just didn’t feel a connection and wishes him well, and he blows up at them and tells them they’ve wasted his time.

We ended up dating for 3 years.

His brother was a saint in comparison & once even punched him in the face after witnessing the verbal abuse towards me & his fiancee the day they came to visit us.

I would've preferred the twin & there was actually an attraction. But it doesn't matter anyway. I got the feeling his twin might've been of the same calibre since when we visited them, he told me 'you're a diamond' and then winked at me & tried to hold my hand. His fiancee was in the bedroom crying on my fiance's shoulder at that time & I know for a fact he was just being that shoulder because he wanted to fk her. 

What a horrible time in my life & I'm glad it's over. If the twin I was with hadn't been sent to prison for what he did to me, I'd probably be dead now. Guy is a lunatic & I pray for any woman that ever entered his life after me. He has a history of abuse, I almost died by his hands, twice.

Please don't say ""why didn't you just leave"" because it's not as easy as that & that type of question does not help anyone in an abusive relationship. Unless you've been there, you will never understand. Ever.

Point is - I'm glad I'm not with either of them.",6

It’s more effective at reducing the intensity, size, and itchiness of mosquito bites than literally anything else I’ve tried. It works because the heat will denature the proteins that cause irritation and because the heat helps with the swelling/inflammation too. The fast you use it after a bite, the more effective it will be, and if you catch it early enough it can even nearly eliminate the reaction to a bite, but even if you don’t use it soon after, it’ll help bites feel a lot better for a bit. 

When I moved across the country, my immune system did *not* like the mosquitos in the new area, and would react strongly to any bites. I’d get golfball sized bites that left bruises for weeks. I avoided going outside for fear of bites, and the bites I did get got in the way of sleeping well or enjoying things.

But I was a hormone induced teenager who didn’t know any better. 

4 years later, her ""best friend"" is now too close to her. I knew with certainty that the guy had feelings for her, but she kept denying. I asked her not to go out with him. Caught them red handed. We had a big fight and a breakup and she promised she would never do it again and along with some serious sex I had agreed. 

I went to university later that year. It was a 6 hour drive from our hometown, so our relationship had already become a long distance. I stupidly believed we could still make it. I swear there were girls throwing themselves at me at university but I never cared. 2 years later I get secret tip from my boys that they saw her with her new best friend (a new one) in a ""overly friendly"" attitude. I put my spies to work and once again caught her red handed. I checked her phone and what I found devastated me. 

She was regularly having sex with his new best friend and admitted they were friends with benefits. Found their sexting and her nudes. On top of that, she was regularly going out with her ex-best friend (the old one) and the two of them even went to a trip out of town in a weekend. 

I just wanted to know, why? She said I was ""too high profile"" for her. I was meritorious, rich, high-principled, with a similar social circle and friends who protected me like a wall. I was ""too perfect. A diamond she could never hold on to."" 

I cried my heart out that day. I really wanted her to feel what I was feeling. But decided she was not worth it. She begged to return to my life for almost a year but my heart was definitely stone cold by then. 

Fast forward a year later. I found the sweetest and funniest girl in the planet. My mom loves her more than I do probably (she hated my ex). After being in a relationship for 2 years, we decided to get married. I am, by the grace of the Almighty, so happy and in peace now. In a job as an engineer in one of the top companies in the country and also working with a professor in my field of electrical engineering, in the process of pursuing a PhD next year. 

She on the other hand, according to my friends, is in one of her new quests with a new best friend.",9

TB was a death sentence back then.  Soldiers who got it were sent back to the states to TB wards where most died.

One day a doctor announced to the ward that they were looking for volunteers for a medical experiment.  He and one other guy volunteered and lived.  The rest died.  The experiment was heavy duty antibotics.

During his recovery, he met a young female nurse, fell in love, married her and moved to MA.  They had 7 kids.  I am the oldest of all the grandkids.

While rounding what we thought would be a secluded corner my friend pulled out a joint and went to light up, the noise of the lighter sparking caused something up the trail to turn around quickly... I couldn't tell what it was right away because the lighting was dappled from trees above and it was colored the same as the trail and rock.

I grabbed my friends arm and quietly said stop, stand up, don't turn around, walk backwards slowly... about 30 feet in front of us was a cougar. Easily bigger than any dog I've ever seen, save a great dane or bernese, but the musculature on it was otherworldly compared to any dog. It wasn't crouched like it was going to come for us, it was turned halfway with it's back arched, the way a housecat sizes up another housecat before they fight.

We backed up staring at the thing for what felt like forever, but was only probably 3-4 seconds before it realized we weren't coming towards it anymore and turned tail. It bounded up what I thought was a sheer 20-foot cliff with such ease it made my mind truly spin at the power of nature and thankful I wasn't asked to test it.

At about a quarter of the distance there is a little river crossing the track with a sloping riverside path. The doggie loved to run ahead and jump straight in the water. On this day however, we did not hear the usual splashing sounds so we went a little faster.

Well, we found the dog on the riverside path, with her nose deep between the buttcheeks of a completely naked man, who happened to take his no less naked female acquaintance in missionary there.

Been an epileptic for almost 17 years now.

Unfortunately, my Epilepsy has evolved into tonic clonic seizures, I rarely have absence’s anymore, but had one focal back in November.

After I suddenly went blind in my left eye and got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, I connected the dots.

Edit: Facial twitches are normal! Just because you have twitches often doesn't mean you have a problem, especially if you don't have any other reason to believe you have multiple sclerosis or any other disease.

18urxvw,kfoiido,"Everybody misunderstands how drugs like Adderall treat ADHD. You always hear people claiming that if a neurotypical person takes it, it hypes them up, whereas if somebody with ADHD takes it, it calms them down. This is wrong. People with ADHD aren't extra hyper. Rather, they act exactly as a neurotypical person would act if devoid of any rewarding stimulus. A regular person wouldn't sit still for long at a desk in an empty room with nothing to do. They would pace in circles and fidget and lose themselves deep in daydreams, because that's what humans do when they're bored.   


People with ADHD are bored a lot more often, because their brain's reward system is broken. They don't get tiny little dopamine hits for completing necessary tasks like the rest of us do. The reward system is everything. Without the rush of happy chemicals from sex, nobody would breed. Hunger might suffice to compel one to eat, but we would all be undernourished if food didn't taste good and if our brains didn't give us a hit of happy chemicals for eating something tasty.   


Doing your homework or some necessary adulting doesn't give a fraction of the dopamine hit as getting laid, but it's still something. But if you have ADHD, it's basically nothing. You don't complete your tasks because you literally have no incentive. You fidget and get distracted because your brain is telling you there is literally nothing else to do.   


What drugs like Adderall do is make the reward system generate a whole lot more happy chemicals. Enough that someone with ADHD is suddenly incentivized to do one's work. (Neurotypicals, meanwhile, are just extra-extra incentivized). You can give Adderall to a kid and watch him sit down at his desk and do his work, but by no means is that kid ""calm."" That kid is intensely focused. He is more ""awake"" than he has ever been. He has more energy than he has ever had, but he's narrowly focusing all that energy on a single task.   


The way people talk about untreated ADHD, you would think it's just like being hypomanic, but it's nothing like that. It's much more akin to clinical depression, and the meds do the same exact thing to them as to neurotypicals. The only difference is that with ADHD, you're bringing a broken reward system to equilibrium by flooding it, whereas if you have a normal reward system, it's just extra flooded.",913

Unlike the gambler's fallacy, in the Monty Hall Problem your first choice influences the results of the second. When you picked your first door there were three cases- in two of them you picked the goat, and in one you picked the money. Odds are 2 in 3 that you selected the goat. You still have that door when the other goat is eliminated, meaning that the odds are now 2 in 3 that the remaining door is the money, when accounting for the previous cases.",2164

He had to return to England - it's likely that if he had followed the name carved on the post (CROATOAN) he would have found a number of colonists still alive and well, either living with or being helped by natives.

So when a bar shows, say, a boxing match, apparently they are supposed to buy the match separately on each TV. So for a big sports bar with 75 TVs, it can be pricey. Some bars will just buy a couple, or even one license and broadcast them on all of the TVs. 

The boss would buy the rights to pursue the offenders (IIRC the process) and then sue the bar owners per tv that the fight was shown on, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. 

The part that felt unethical was that he didn’t do this full time, as his main gig. He kept all of these “fight rights” on deck, and whenever he needed money to put in a pool, or invest in something new, he’d pick one of his files that hadn’t expired yet, sue the bar owner into oblivion, sometimes years after the fight, and then move on to whatever the new opportunity was.

I lived with my terminally Ill brother, whose name was James and mine Jamie, so we had the same address phone number and initials and similar names. When they ran my pharmacy report as they normally do, my brother’s many medications showed up on my list. The doctor yelled at me, called me a drug seeker and kicked me out of the office while I cried and pleaded with him to listen to me and that those medications were my brothers and not mine. He said that is not possible and that couldn’t happen. I ended up calling the board of pharmacy, who informed me that yes, closely named relatives who live together could show up on the same report, and the name doesn’t show but a patient number does, and if the doctor looks closely he will see 2 different numbers. The board member called the doctor and said he had to search by my SS# to get a more thorough search. Upon doing this, he realized his mistake and profusely apologized and my visit was free. He had no idea that 2 people could show up on the same report if they have similar details, and now he tells this story at all his conferences so other doctors don’t make the same mistake.

17j9bn7,k70zfuq,"For a very long time the Roman empire was able to acquire silk through trade over 'the silk road' to China, but never able to unlock the secrets of producing it domestically themselves. Until 552AD, when two monks preaching in India then travelled to China, where they witnessed the guarded methods of using the live silk worm to spin the famous thread. Knowing the importance of what they'd learned, the monks returned to Constantinople to report directly to the emperor Justinian. He personally met the monks, heard all the details of what they'd seen, then asked them to return to China and find a way of smuggling these worms back to the empire. They agreed, and prepared for the 2 year ~6,500km (4,000mi) trek back to China on foot, hoof and wheel. Once back in China they acquired either eggs or young larvae, since the adults are too delicate for transport, and tucked them into hollowed bamboo canes for the long journey straight back home. Once the monks made it back to Constantinople (modern Istanbul, Turkey), domestic silk production slowly ramped up and the need for long journeys along the 'silk road' ramped down. Over time, this allowed the same type of silk monopoly which China had enjoyed through the prior centuries to now be established in the Mediterranean, becoming one of the bedrocks of the Byzantine economy for the next 700 years.

It's crazy to think about these two guys. 1500 years before you or I were born, making their second multi-year, 6,500km trek back from China, smuggling two bamboo canes full of bugs which would fuel the economy of one of the world's largest civilizations for the next 700 years. I wonder if they knew and understood these possibilities when they went to scoop the worms from their baskets in China...Imagine the anxiety trying to keep them hidden and alive the whole way back!",462
17j9bn7,k7063oh,"John “Mad Jack” Churchill was a British officer in World War Two. He’s famous because he brought along a Scottish claymore, bagpipes, and a bow and got the “only confirmed longbow kill of the Second World War.” One time he was with part of his commando unit and a shell exploded and injured everyone but him, so he played a Scottish Jacobite song on his bagpipes until the Germans captured him and sent him to a prison camp. He promptly escaped via a tunnel he dug and almost got to the ocean before he got recaptured. By then, it was April 1945, and the German military was falling apart, so they let him go soon pretty quickly. He’s famous for the quote “any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed”.

TLDR he led a commando battalion, used a sword and a longbow in the 1940s, was captured while playing bagpipes as his buddies fell around him, and then escaped by digging a tunnel out of a prison camp.
