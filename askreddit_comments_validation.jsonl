The test involved attaching the unit to a reader, then run loads of command line commands. Then, one would have to make a copy of all the text, copy it into word and save it as a (real crappy looking) report. There was HUNDREDS of units, and they needed to be testet several times a year. We did about 20-30 a day. It would take several weeks to finish. \n\nI didn't know coding at the time, but always wanted to learn it.\n\nWithin two months, I had made a program, even with a GUI (to spot faults with ease, instead of having to actually READ the reports). The program could read three units at a time, and would automatically create a smooth pdf report and save it on our server, named with serial number and date.\n\nThe job was now to attach three units, then wait for about 3 minutes, detach and attach new ones. Basically 30 seconds work, 3 minutes break. I could now test all units in a day, though I would typically spread it out over a couple more days.\n\nWhen I left the company, I left the program on the test computer. I got an email from an ex colleague a few months later, saying they were using the program on several ships now. There wasn't any manual for the program, of course, but it was so straight forward that it wasn't needed."}]}

More importantly, members of Congress are constitutional officers. The President (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution. As such, they're all constitutionally entitled to pay.\n\nArticle 1, Section 6 of the Constitution:\n\n>The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\n\n27th Amendment:\n\n>No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.\n\nIt also functionally wouldn't do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (AOC for example). The shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that *need* that money imminently, which is not the vast majority of Congress and certainly not the President. So that amendment would functionally not be much more than a feel-good effort."}]}

If you're making 500K selling your soul to a big corporation, than your check for being a part of congress is an after thought. Mean while freshmen senators who realistically spent nearly all of their money on campaigning to get into congress and change a broken system will be the only ones to suffer. \n\nSo this could just help the spread of corruption against high ranking government members. Although why should they be exempt from suffering the way TSA workers or Prison workers do?\n\nI feel that instead of stopping anyone from getting payed, if a budget isn't agreed upon, than we have an emergency 3 months airbag where we pay federal workers for those 3 months and essentially use the previous budget. If those 3 months go by and still no movement is made, then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency. Something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president. This later one is dangerous because there are times that congress would be willing to kill it's self to kick a sitting president out of power, such as republicans during the Obama administration, and I suspect Democrats during the Trump administration.\n\nAdditionally congress should be forced into a minimum of 8 hour work days with the president sitting in on the meeting trying to find a compromise. There should be no vacations, time off, or excuses with the exception of terminal illness. If a member of congress fails to show up, they would effectively be removed from congress, and if the sitting President or Vice President is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget."}]}

And then watched my run turn into a walk, then a crawl. I dragged us through every day. It happened the last two weeks of school and I still went to their end of the year award programs and smiled even though neighbors were whispering and I hosted birthday parties minus a parent and I taught one to drive. I am not completely sure how I was strong enough but I brought us all forward in those dark days. I wasn’t going to let this affect them. And now, even with their dad living three miles away with his new family and acting like they don’t exist, I crawl, with them on my back.\n\nEdit: I really appreciate all the kindness. It’s comforting to hear the positive thoughts as it’s often so isolating. I can’t believe I received so many comments. I plan to read and respond to all. Oh and the awards! Wow!

In summary, the fall of Constantinople was kind of inevitable. The empire was in its last legs, due in large part to the the fall during the fourth crusade in 1204. It had a lot of internal and external problems. For example, Konstantinos Palaiologos was never officially coronated, due to religious infighting. The Ottoman empire had already conquered all of the farmland around, and was right to go for the kill at the time that it did. It conquered a great strategic and cultural landmark. The Hagia Sophia had already become a mosque in 29th May 1453, 2.30 in the afternoon. It's a pity for my heritage, but at that time I think it was inevitable.\n\nEdit: wtf guys thanks!! O.O\nEdit no. 2: Actually no, guys, the paper wasn't on There might be giants! It was on Greek folk laments on the event of the fall, and how accurate were their lyrics in relation to the actual event. (There were fairly accurate, also deeply sad and lamenting the loss of a symbol, mostly, not the city itself)."}]}

In reality there was not much holding the remnants of the Byzantine Empire alive once the farmland in Anatolia had been conquered realistically the city would only be able to survive for so long. In addition the Ottomans raising taxes on trade would block off connections to China and India which would help to encourage the Spaniards and Portuguese as well as the Dutch later on in their maritime shipping interests.

In addition men, on average, have fewer close friends and feel lonelier than women. I think the fatigue of such a life can be quite draining. \n\nI don't think the problem is that men do not talk about their feelings. I think the problem is that they often don't have someone to talk to. \nIn addition, it can be quite hard to make new friends. Especially when you are past your twenties. You know, people you are potentially interested in are married and have kids. They are preoccupied with their own lives. \n\nI felt very lonely and sad after my last long term relationship ended. It took me over 6 months to find new friends and I'm a hardcore extrovert. Still, I made a bunch of new friends within the past year or so. \n\nI'd like to encourage anyone who feels lonely to put yourself out there. Talk to people. If you like them, ask them if they like to hang out with you. Do you know how I became friends with one of my best friends? I straight up told him that I felt lonely and that I like him and would like to become friends with him. \nAnd for those of you who already have plenty of friends and a busy life: Maybe make some room for people in your community who aren't as blessed as you are."}]}

If so, how did you overcome this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I had this feeling for all my life after puberty.\n\n\nThere were these high ideals that I always maintained and couldn't live up to them. Mostly because they were about saving the world and unattainable things like that. I spent an absurd amount of my teenage years studying philosophy and religion rather than dealing with teenage social issues like my peers. Ever since I was a kid, I had this goofy side though. When I wasn't pulling my hair out reading about semiotics, I would write silly stories to make people laugh.\n\nWhen I went to college, things changed. I began exhibiting some really dangerous behavior patterns, especially for someone with a huge conscience like myself. The line between my public and private life got larger. I began feeling I could no wrong. I don't really want to list some of the things I did here because of shame. But suffice it to say, you would have all hated college me.\n\nI'm going to skip to the end and just say this all got worse until I woke up one day and all my lightheartedness was gone. I was working a high paying meaningless job. I'd cheated on everyone I dated and thrown away every romantic relationship, some very painfully.\n\nMy life had become all about money, sex, and status.\n\nThe biggest epiphany of my life was realizing two things.\n\nOne, everyone goes through some form of this. We all try on different faces. If we find one that doesn't fit, we still tend to cling to it so that we don't have to change our current comfort level. This phase is normal and human.\n\n\nTwo, I was bipolar. Manic. My post puberty life was punctuated by periods of unbelievable energy and increasingly risky behavior. It put me on top - there were years where I had fans. I got up on stage and gave speeches and made people laugh and was the center of attention. And later it landed me in jail because the center cannot hold.\n\nBut with that diagnosis I finally was able to figure out my history and why I could never live up to those ideals. Because grandiosity is a textbook manic symptom too.\n\nThese days I don't push myself to do any more than love my family and enjoy the little things. I've lived more than most people do in a lifetime. I deserve a rest, at least for a little while.\n\nSorry this is so long.\n\n\nThe answer is that the normal cycle is to lose yourself for a little while and then find yourself again. Everyone has an existential crisis to some degree. You have to trust that this is normal and your real self is always there waiting for your return.\n\nHow you return, that will be unique. A death in the family, jail, overdose, failed relationship, financial loss, you name it. Something has to touch you deeply and it will happen. In the natural course of things we all take a big hit sooner or later.\n\n\nI don't like to generalize but the 20s are a time when people tend to drift away from themselves. After that it's really anyone's guess when you'll come back.\n\nBut since you're asking this question, I say it will be sooner than later for you."}]}

For we think in terms of languages and images which we did not invent, but which were given to us by society... Our social environment has this power just because we do not exist apart from a society. Society is our extended mind and body. Yet the very society from which the individual is inseparable is using its whole irresistible force to persuade the individual that he is indeed separate! Society as we now know it is therefore playing a game with self-contradictory rules“."}]}
