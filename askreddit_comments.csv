The community is still small but it really reminds me of reddit back in the day, where there were a lot of interesting people from very diverse backgrounds posting cool things that I never would have seen otherwise. 

It's invite only, but they have a megathread you can post to and get access pretty easily if you have an active reddit account.",308

Edited for clarity",14689

136jqkc,jip53ex,This is misinformation.,839
136jqkc,jipgu3y,"That's not exactly what he said. 

He said billionaires shouldn't exist. When pressed, he said it wasn't that the person shouldn't exist, but a system that allows people to accumulate that much wealth, where a small handful of people have more wealth then 70% of the nation, shouldn't exist. 

He wants to tax them at the rate they were taxed when Eisenhower was President, because if they were taxed like that, the excess wealth then goes back into their companies, their employees, charity, etc. 

Wallace kept pressing with the same ""So you want to confiscate everything over a billion?"" and then Bernie finally said ""They'd be fine with $999,999.""

People always say that he wants to take money from the rich, but he just wants a system that doesn't allow the rich to take money from everyone else. 

So, if legislation isn't going to be created to fix everything (let's face it, it never will be), the easiest route is to just raise their taxes.",289
136jqkc,jip0hq4,"I think the average redditor has absolutely no idea that there is a difference between income and wealth, and that forcing someone to liquidate their wealth is completely impractical and moronic",565

Edit: a lot of people have offered the counterpoint that this argument is incomplete at best and misleading at worst, and I concede (to a point). The majority of people against taxing the ultrawealthy that I know, have spoken about their mistrust of the government. That mistrust, and what *about* the government they don't trust, is a separate and much deeper conversation to me. 


See, this is why I left facebook for reddit. I would have just been hit with parroted talking points or cheap insults. Here, I'm given plenty to think about.",941
134qerl,jihpk10,My ex-boyfriends mother was a linguistics professor and knew over 10 languages. She was also one of the dumbest people I've ever met. Some examples: she believed that in case of emergency stewardesses catapult out of the plane; she was also convinced donating blood causes some blood disease and you can die because of it.

134qerl,jig7j18,"This is basically what The Best And The Brightest by David Halberstam is about. It tells the story of how the Kennedy and Johnson administrations got the United States into the Vietnam war, and it particularly zeroed in on Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. He kept escalating the conflict at every turn, and if you questioned him he could bury you in data showing that the US was winning the war and the Defense Department just needed more troops and more money to put us over the top. I'm grossly oversimplifying a great book, but that's the gist of it. 

A great companion piece to the book is a documentary called The Fog Of War by Errol Morris. It's a one on one interview with Robert McNamara filmed near the end of his life where he ruminates on the lessons he's learned. After watching it 90% of people come away from the experience thinking that McNamara is a particularly intelligent and sagacious man, even though there's a mountain of evidence showing that that's not the case",1462

He disappeared and came back about 8 weeks later. His range was non-existant, maybe 30 degrees of range in total. He was visibly mad at me, as if it was my fault, actually was shouting and calling me incompetent. Our conversation went something like this:

So this 60 something year old suffers from an acute complication and gets a Pacemaker to solve the problem. Everything goes normally and as planned, he recovers, every care and meds that he needs to take are prescribed, explained and medical appointments with a Cardiologist/Arritmologist are scheduled so that he may get the follow-up he needs.

The man then prooceds to never show up to any appointment and never answear any calls from the hospital to know of him and reschedule. This went on for around 3 years. Until he shows up without former warning and asks to talk with the doctor that did the procedure to put his pacemaker. People are weirded out but seeing that on that day the doctor was present and this patient was in clear distress, they talk to him and manage a couple of minutes to have the doctor check on him.

Inside the appointment room, the doctor takes notice that this man is wearing a bra inside his shirt. The man explains he has been wearing his daughters bra for 3 months after his ""problem"" got worse. The shirt is asked to be taken off and there he stands, the shirtless man wearing his daughters bra, showing off the pacemaker, that should have been kept inside his body, dangling outside of it, being hold by the left bra cup, with a big infected open wound above it with the pacemaker leads still inserted onto his veins and connected to his heart.

Nobody has any idea how the man let that situation come to be or how he didnt die of sepsis or any other health problem that may appear for that matter.

Parents claim their child hasn't eaten anything before surgery, as they were carefully directed.

I've rarely seen my brother so angry (and disgusted - somehow biscuits and gravy looks even more nauseating the second time around) and he was just recounting what had happened. I have no doubt he tore a strip off the parents once their five-year-old was stabilized, and they probably still felt justified and angry at the surgeon for telling them what they could and could not feed their child right before anesthesia.


ETA The parents did in fact feel justified and hard-done-by, although afaik they didn't express anger at my brother (knowing him, they didn't get a word in edgewise).

14ed5fp,jov0llz,I'm speaking as a teacher...but I've seen wildly different siblings.  I think parents need to get a handle on that dynamic.  A lot of perfectionist older siblings and younger ones who can't achieve at that level and act out instead to find how they can earn attention.,7039

14ed5fp,jovao84,"You don't have to win every power struggle.

I don't have jerk kids. But I do think I've learned a lot from having 4 very different kids, and I think too many parents 1. Think the same strategies work for all kids (ie, rule-consequence-behavior falls in line, rinse and repeat) and 2. Focus on the behavior rather than the cause.

If you have a kid who doesn't respond to your parenting style/philosophy, you should rethink your approach. It's not all the kid's fault.

Some kids will burn their lives to the ground to make a point. I have one like that. For too long, it was a vicious cycle of

* kid acts out
* I punish
* kid is angry, acts out more
* I punish harder
* kid is angrier, acts out even more
* I punish even harder

and on and on and on and on. Something needs to break the cycle.

For instance, if your kid is challenging your authority, it's usually a bid for more independence. They're trying to be more mature, and they want your adult respect. You don't have to excuse the bad behavior; consequences are OK. But you ALSO have to look for ways to help your kid get that need met.

You don't have to tie it to the actual incident, so it doesn't look like a reward. Give them more responsibility for themselves.

* Let him walk to school alone if he doesn't get to do that.
* Quit bugging him so much about what he does with his free time, even if you think he should be ""getting more fresh air.""
* Look for any opportunity to let him choose something. ""We're going to do something as a family on Sunday. You can choose what we do."" or where we eat or whatever.
* Don't tell him WHEN he has to do his chores. Let him set his Saturday schedule: ""I need you to mow the lawn and do the dishes today. You can do it any time between now and 6 p.m.""

If you address the cause of the behavior, it's going to do way more to correct a bad behavior, and you'll also get more respect from your kid.

If you insist on winning every power struggle, your kid is going to see everything as a fight.

EDIT: I need to give my wife credit for helping me understand this over the years. She's not only a great mom and wife, she's also a really good therapist. She's gained a lot of perspective working with other kids and parents and working on those relationships.",33241
14ed5fp,jovir5x,"In my opinion, the one defining characteristic of bad parents is being resentful of their own children. Resentful that they took some of their freedom, resentful of their youth, resentful of their opportunities, resentful of their intelligence, resentful of their beauty, resentful of their possessions, resentful of their education, resentful of their accomplishments, resentful of their happiness, etc. I think this is FAR more common than most people realize. These parents may consciously “provide” for their kids while they unconsciously sabotage them. The kids pick up on this and end up aspiring to their parents’ unspoken expectations.

Good parents want their kids to exceed their own achievements and, most importantly, to be happy. Good parents are empathetic to their children. They’re happy when their kids are happy. They’re sad when their kids are sad. Resentful parents don’t really want their kids to be happy unless they credit the parents for their happiness.

If they watch you serve others in need and get joy from that or love those around you, they may grow up wanting that joy themselves. 

You want them to be responsible with alcohol? SHOW them how to be responsible. 

You want them to learn from their mistakes? Then when you make a mistake, own up to it and apologize. Show them no one should be too prideful to admit they were wrong and do better the next time.

To the extent that all 3 of her kids were estranged from her for a bit, but 2 of them (including my uncle ""Ed"") have been reconnected for decades.

My uncle, vowing to never be this strict with his kids, essentially just never disciplined his kids. Whenever Ed and my Aunt Lana had an issue with them, the kids could go to Ed and get out of it because he was kind of a pushover. They grew up to be rude, didn't respect curfews at like age 12. The son always had some sort of issue (my family is very hush hush about mental health, I think it's ADHD) that led to angry bursts as a kid and they tried their best with medication but it kind of mellowed him out into a shell of himself till they found a better med combo.

Another thing that may play a role is they're half black (my side) and half white (Ed's side). I won't pretend to know if there was an identity issue growing up, but I was very judgmental of them because they kind of both tried to act ""ghetto"" like they grew up in a tough neighborhood with a hood accent and I'm like.. No you grew up in one of the most affluent neighborhoods in the state with both parents and a lot of chances.

So yeah, last year my mom admits to me both of the cousins got into drugs and had to go to rehab. Again, knowing my family they'd freak out at weed but I think it was that and also opiates. And I'm just shaking my head thinking that this is kind of all on my cousins.",756

I was adopted, and told a silly, magical story about my birth parents that most certainly did not seem true even when I was a child. 

At 57, I learned I was the result of a college affair between a very seriously Jewish young man and a very Baptist young woman. She was rushed off to a home for wayward girls to give birth. He followed her there (many states away), begging her to keep me and live a life together.  But their families both said absolutely not. Jewish people were not viewed as ""white"" in the mid-60s, and her family most certainly did not want her marrying a non-white. Plus, she was a very committed Christian and did not want to convert to Judaism. 

So off I went, into another family. I recently discovered three lovely half-siblings and we are all pro or semi-pro musicians and get along well. I never got to meet my mother; she died a year before I searched. My father is out of the picture and wants to be left alone. And I'm fine with that; I'm grateful for the love he gave me.

147rws8,jnxn5p1,"I'm not a photographer but I used to work with a wedding cake baker staging and setting up. It was always a bad sign whenever I saw the groom smash the cake into the bride's face during the first bite when she didn't. If they both did it my boss never said anything but if he did it to her and she hadn't done it to him at all, she would say it wouldn't work out. She had a pretty good track record!",714

147rws8,jny56oi,"At the rehearsal, the groom refused to sit next to the bride and insisted on sitting next to his female best friend. The priest said "" Don't you want to sit next to your soon to be wife?"" Kind of chuckling like the groom had just not gotten around to sitting next to her yet.

He says ""I have the rest of my life to sit next to her"".

The gasp from both sides of the family was AUDIBLE. Everyone was horrified. He did not move.

Bride spent the rehearsal dinner crying in the bathroom. 

They still went through the wedding the next day, which was in October. She kicked him out and filed for divorce AND annulment (Catholic) by that December.",230
147rws8,jnxmgb6,"Not a photographer, but at the ceremony, the minister asked the bride's friends & family to say some affirmation (like ""we do"" or similar) about how they supported the marriage. Those people said the affirmation and cheered loudly.

The minister then asked the groom's friends & family to do the same thing. Dead silence.

The minster, very flustered, said ""hey how about I give you folks another chance"" and again asked the groom's friends & family to affirm their support of this marriage. This time - dead silence.

Minister continued with the ceremony. Couple lasted maybe a few years.

Backstory: many of the groom's friends & family had \*begged\* him not to marry this woman, up to and including the day of the wedding. She was that horrible.",1344
147rws8,jnxc1ww,"When cutting the cake, she playfully got some on his face. He proceeded to grab a giant chunk and PUNCH her in the face with it, several times hard. She was digging it out from underneath her eyelids bawling and her Dad needed to be held back. 

EDIT: Alot of people have been asking, so here is a bit more backstory. My guess as to why people were holding the Dad back was that the Groom was in full Marine dress uniform and they used his sword to cut the cake, that sword was very much in arms reach of the Groom after this happened, so everyone was probably worried something really bad could happen if those two got near each other. After the incident, it was really awkwardly silent as the Groom apologized to the family and if I remember correctly (this was 10 years ago or so) him and the Dad went outside for around 20 minutes, then came back in. The rest of the reception went normally after that.",9187

Brother in law is still best friends with my husband (as far as he's concerned he gained a brother and lost a sister and is better off for it) and he never lets him forget the fact that he was right and he should have bailed lol.

During the vows I don't touch the camera, just step back and let it run. So I'm spaced out waiting for the vows to finish and notice a radio tower far across the valley. Suddenly lightning hits the radio tower. I had enough time to think ""Boy when the thunder gets here it'll probably loud."" 

I also had enough time to clue in that the minister was saying ""If anyone objects to this union let him speak now or forever..."" KEBLAMMMMMMMM!

Total silence in the venue. Preacher takes a second to look around and make sure everybody is alright, on one has been smote. ""Well that's never happened before.""

His best story (and one of the reasons he stopped including the question) was a couple where the lead up to the wedding the couple was obviously in love. The bride to be was very smiley and happy. Day of the wedding she’s stone faced. He knows something is up because he’s never seen her like this and he asks if she is ok. “I’m fine.” 

Right before the service he asks again. “I’m fine.”

He gets to the question, “Does anyone object to this union?”

The bride reaches over, grabs the maid of honor, shoves her into the bride’s spot and says, “You’re screwing him, you marry him.” And then stormed out of the church.",25192
13ec6op,jjpxyvw,"I dunno if it's a UK thing or even just a one specific church thing but I was told by the priest in a rehearsal that if someone objects, even as a joke, the priest is required to pause the ceremony and talk to the objector alone to discuss their concerns and decide if they have a valid objection. Like it's not a fun jokey moment, it's a real legal part of the ceremony.

He also said it used to be custom that if you raised an invalid objection you then had to pay for the wedding.",10903
13ec6op,jjpvbj7,"A relative visited one ceremony where it was asked if anyone objects, and the groom decided it's a good time for a joke and said ""I do"".

My uncle was getting married. Small, just a handful of family and a minister. I was videotaping. 

My grandmother was not into it at all. With each line spoken by the minister, she had a cutting, sarcastic response. I could not believe it. It was so unlike her, 

When that part came up, she said “I object. But does it really matter? They are going to to do it anyway.”

The minister just ignored her and proceeded, business as usual.

They were divorced within a year.

He’d apparently come into a lot of money he came to the side door front of the church said he objected because he’s rich and wants her back.

13ec6op,jjqbega,"My buddy wasn’t fully rejected at the altar, which sounds weird but I’ll explain. 

Without too much “back in the day” talk I’ll just say the groom was/is a good friend of mine I’d known since middle school (7th grade). 

He’d met this awesome gal and they were slated to be married in our then early 30’s. 

Come the wedding day and it’s almost a high school reunion of sorts (we attended a smallish private school), everyone stoked to see our grade school pal get married. 

We’re all seated outside waiting for the bride to come out and a reasonable amount of time goes by. People are just carrying on, catching up etc. I’ve got a flask and sharing it with people. The groom goes inside to see what’s up..

More time goes on, then some more, then my flask is empty and I want to go reload at the car but think better of it. 

Then the groom comes back out to address everyone and let’s us know that “this isn’t happening today, the bride doesn’t want to go through with it. We’re still together and everything but now isn’t the time….” then goes on to encourage everyone to eat the food, it’s already paid for etc. 

Here we are about 5 years later and they’re still together but not married. No harm, no foul I guess?",635
13ec6op,jjrchg5,"It didn't happen at that, but it happened on the wedding day. I was going to my aunt's fourth wedding, and pretty much was only there for the free food. It was before the ceremony was about to begin, me and my brother overheard my uncle, who has never gotten along with my aunt, talking to the groom and basically told him ""You're better off running lad. Her past three marriages have all ended up dead, all due to car crashes. Bit odd that, don't you think.""

The groom thought this was indeed odd, and decided to ask myself and my brother, two of our cousins and our other aunt if what my uncle said was true. We told him it was, and thought the bride would have told him before hand. Turns out she never disclosed the fact she had been previously married before. So the groom, for all intents and purposes, fled the church. 

Safe to say it was a dramatic day after that.",214
13ec6op,jjqcel1,"Well, sort of. It was staged, pre arranged, and the minister was warned ahead of time. 


The couple said they wanted to make the ceremony more interesting. So they had a friend object, declaring his love for the bride in  an over the top dramatic speech. 


The best man (my husband) stabbed the guy with a stage dagger, he played dead, and two of the other groomsmen dragged his limp body away. The wedding proceeded.

He had his whole family on board.  Weather was closing in.  He agreed that it was impossible to get home, but wanted to make it to a larger municipal airport so they wouldn't have to stay in a motel.  The fuel attendant and a bunch of old veteran pilots hanging around the airport office all said they'd drive him to a nicer place, but he thought he'd have a better chance of getting out the next day from the other airport.  Conditions weren't *that* bad when he took off, but we all agreed later that no one without instrument rating would/should have flown that day.

Then my parents had to step out and take a bunch of phone calls. They sounded very stressed. They kept telling me nothing happened and everything was okay. Eventually we flew home, and surprise!! Took an extra couple days to go to a big Waterpark away from home. 

I fondly remembered this birthday and eventually forgot about any of the weirdness. 

Maybe 10 years later my parents finally told me what happened. My uncle, my dad's brother, tried to kill himself on my 7th birthday. He shot himself in the stomach with a rifle. He was poor, addicted to drugs, no work, etc. He felt depressed my dad had the life he always wanted, so tried to kill himself. 

He ended up living. My parents took me to the Waterpark so that we didn't have to come home to him leaving the hospital.

Neither of them ever fessed up, though. I only found out about their existence after an aunt died & left me her personal effects. I found birth announcements for these other kids in her mementos. I always thought she meant for me to find them. When I asked my parents, they refused to discuss anything related to these kids.

A few years later, I went back to my hometown & looked up that date in the newspaper morgue. The friend who went with me was floored. I wasn't, really. I'd grown up in fear for my life from her rages.

15uj4um,jwr1pzv,"Will also submit a light one here.  The story of my Grammas real name. 

Let’s say that my whole life I knew my grandmothers name to be “Mary”.  Everyone called her this, everyone knew it.  

Once day when I was in my 20’s I was with my grandmother and saw her sign some legal document.  She signed it as “Edith”, I was horribly confused. I asked gramma about it and she said her name was Edith but it was NEVER spoken and to not use it.  ( she is in her 80’s at this point). 

Apparently my great grandfather had been an Air Force pilot stationed in the UK during WW1.  He had a girlfriend at the time named Edith! After the war was over they broke up. GreatGrandpa returned home and married great grandma shortly after. They had only one child, a girl, whom he named Edith. 

Roughly 18 months later my great grandmother saw a letter in the mail from an Edith and figured it out. She vowed the child would NEVER be called the damn name ever again.  She went by her middle name Mary. Though it was never legally changed. 

My own mother states she did not know her own grandmothers name until she was 22. I have had fun randomly dropping this name bomb on cousins here and there and enjoying the shock and laughter about it. It’s a silly secret that nowadays just makes people giggle.",307

141dfp5,jmzo358,"Undefeated 7 & 8 year old little league baseball coach! 



Especially proud because I was given what they though was a castaway squad. Our tactics we non conventional but we freaking crushed.


Edit:


For those asking about non-traditional tactics. Basically all plays are at first. We don't care if there is a runner on 2nd we are throwing the ball to 1st, where we have our best catcher. We always were shifted away from 3rd base to make the throw to 1st as easy as possible. You might get burned 1-2 times a game by a kid hitting it down the 3rd baseline but in general it was rare enough that defending 3rd was a waste of a player. 95% of balls in play are going to be between shortstop and 1st because 7&8 year olds are hitting for contact and do not know where they are going to hit it, so we packed those areas that give us the best chance for a play at 1st and went there every time.


Also I found it benefited the team more to work with making our weaker players stronger and not focusing on our superstars. This allowed every kid to play more because your studs are going to be good no matter what and probably were getting extra work at home anyways. So I always focused on bringing the bottom players up to par with the rest of the squad and I think that was ultimately the difference more that my janky defense.",4260

You as an employee have next to no power over anything apart from a bit of product knowledge to learning the basics of returns/exchanges.  Any person who has worked in one of these positions can almost always count on at least once a week being faced with a colossal, screaming idiot who will fight tooth and nail over the most idiotic minutia when they are dead wrong.  I don't know if it stems from a need to be correct (narcissism) or from just plain stupidity that they can never concede in a fight, but it is at least a weekly occurrence in retail.

My most recent example was when my partner and I were in Muji, an Asian-themed home goods and clothing store.  The ambience of these stores are super chill, with diffusers going, soft music, and so on.  As we were coming in a woman was losing her mind on the cashier because a pair of socks scanned up at let's call it $10 when they should have been $8.  Numbers are made up because this was a month or so ago.  She is arguing impressively that these socks scanned up wrong and they should be free.  The cashier has the ""wut"" look on her face and is calmly explaining, that no, she can get a refund for the difference.  This lady was not having it, seemingly pulling what she believed was the ultimate trump card, she shouted ""well other stores have policies where they give you the wrong scanned item for free!"".  The cashier again, without a breaking a sweat said ""well, that isn't our policy.  I can either refund you the difference, refund you the whole thing, or you keep it as it is.""  This loop went on for much longer than it had to before the angry customer relented, visibly disturbed that this made-up policy did not exist at Muji.

I will add that she was talking/yelling so that the entire store could hear, of course, instead of calmy discussing the issue and taking the  solution like a normal adult.",3146

Yes, I'm speaking from personal experience .. I was absolutely flooded with these people when I was diagnosed.

Retired Military.

I think the biggest problem in the US is not so much guns but gun culture.  It's how the gun lobby and an entire subset of the population has romanticized a tool for killing. 

We have a lot of problems in this country between media radicalizing the public against each other. Inadequate mental healthcare.  Financial inequality.  It is a breeding ground for violence.  But then you add in a culture that makes highly efficient killing machines easily accessible to these same people and you have a recipie for disaster.

I have my guns.  They are locked up.  I am fully trained on how to use, and maintain them. I don't want my kids getting hands on them.  I don't want a thief getting hands on them.  They are present for their intended purpose and I hope I'm never put in a position where I have to use them.

Gun philosophy in the US has merits but has one unavoidable key flaw.  People, as a collective, are unreliable.  I can ensure that I am trained and responsible.  I can make sure my family is trained and responsible.  But I have no control over anyone else.  If my neighbor is an idiot or having a mental health crisis what will they do with having access to a tool that kills easily, at range with very little effort?",1892

Edit: Because everyone keeps telling me that state guns laws don't matter because I can just drive to another state and buy a gun, I'm going to add to my post. You can only do that with long guns/unregulated firearms. You can't drive to another state, have a Maryland ID and buy a regulated firearm in another state that is illegal in maryland. If a specific type of AR was illegal Maryland and I was a Maryland resident, if I drove to PA and tried to buy said illegal in Maryland AR, as soon as the PA gun dealer saw my Maryland ID they would turn me away and not sell me said firearm. If Maryland were to ban all guns, the same would stand.

But in my experience (and I'm not exactly old and weak) these don't work as planned. Frequently they have the perforated section you can rip off, supposedly to allow access to the ziploc portion. Many times there's glue holding pieces together and the perforated section never seems to extend past that.

Even when not glued, the ziploc is apparently held together by the weak nuclear force and will NOT come apart. There's never enough plastic to pull on, and when there is it's approximately as strong as wet tissue paper. So it just rips.

Edit: I had no idea this would get attention but I’m so glad it did.  Here’s a summary of some tips (thank you to many of the ppl in this thread for their own experiences and tips too!!)

What you should know:

1.  Your patient rights.  You can ask for a referral to a specialist. You can ask for second opinions.  You can ask to see what is in your chart.  Know your rights.

2. If you have a family member in a hospital or long term care home, please visit and be there as much as possible.   When you are sick or old you are just not able to summon the energy to be on top of Med errors or even general care.   The more eyes on the care and environment the better for your family member.

3.  Advocate for your family member.  Do some research too:  what is the illness? What are some options?  And take these to the doctor and ask if they’re appropriate (with the patients consent obviously) for the patient.


4.  Follow up.  If the office doesn’t call you : FOLLOW UP.  Keep following up with offices, pharmacies, specialists, etc.  until you’re satisfied.


5. If you are in the States, review your bill. Go over every item and see what can be negotiated and hound them until you feel it’s fair.  The squeaking wheel gets the grease.


5.  Get a job in health care.  Not a clinician? No problem: environmental services and portering are excellent well-paying entry-level jobs that can get you potentially into a union.  You will learn hospital and health care really fast.  


6. Before your family member goes home from hospital make sure you see a “discharge planner” or a “social worker” to talk about discharge.  Hospitals are full and they usually are pressed to send people home fast with health care at home being an option: but it’s not the only option.  Talk to the discharge planner and push back if you need to.  Look up questions to ask the discharge planner.


7.  If you want the doctor to do/prescribe/refer something and they CHOOSE NOT TO, you are within your rights to say “May I have that option noted in my chart?  I’d like to keep track of what I’ve asked you about”.   Innocent, right?  Well it’s a good way to get the clinician to think about whether they want their rebuttal of your suggestion in the chart.

8. If it feels wrong, please see someone else.  Don’t just blindly trust health professionals.  They’re people too.  They’re not magic.  Some are better than others.  read clinician reviews so you at least know what to expect.


To all those folks who go into appts with chronically ill family, or partners, you are guardian angels.   Keep doing what you’re doing.  It is more supportive (and the optics for the clinicians matter) than you know.",12068

The simple genius of it was so giddying that I felt compelled to steal it when I wrote the program notes for one of the performers in a student comedy show I directed. 

Another performer in that show was a guy called Neil Mullarkey, who went on to form a double act with a young Canadian comedian called Mike Myers. He and Mike both loved that phrase, but neither of them knew where I'd got it from, so Mike just stole it again.

Decades later, I got in touch with David Berglas (then aged 90) via his son and apologised for nicking it. He got back to say he was delighted to find out how Mike Myers had come by that phrase, and told me I'm forgiven. He's still alive today and nearly a hundred years old.

First of all, only part of the team are drillers. There are still astronauts actually flying the shuttles. All the drillers were trained to do was spacewalk and survive while drilling in space. Secondly, the film shows that they did try training astronauts how to drill but they were failing at it. Bruce Willis’s character had created the most advanced drill that was needed to drill the asteroid but it was complicated to use. With the time crunch, Bruce Willis explained that there was not going to be enough time to teach them properly and it would be easier to teach the experienced drillers how to do spacewalks.

I ""felt"" like I lost because I was dumbfounded by their argument and realised quickly that it was a belief system that I was up against and didnt want to waste either of our time (the person being a naturopath that my wife used to go to). They had obviously had this argument many times and had various convoluted responses to all your standard points. Essentially, they had more experience in this argument than me. 

Thankfully, that interaction resulted in my kids no longer having to take so much ""medicine"" which was my main issue because I could see that it was eroding their confidence.

""I will never argue with a flat-earther, or an anti-vaxxer, or any of those people. The reason is because that these people have made that into _their whole identity_, and they are prepared to address any possible argument I could come up with. And because I care about facts and truth and they do not, my only possible response would be '...uh, I'll have to look into that, I don't know off the top of my head'. It doesn't matter that their response is incorrect or based on faulty research or has been rejected by the scientific community or whatever; by the time I discover that, they will be long gone and talking about how they won another debate.""

This is it in a nutshell. If you argue about an issue with someone who has made _that one issue_ into the core of their persona, you will lose unless you are someone who has made arguing against that issue also into the core of your persona. 

Of course I know that Andrew Wakefield is a liar and a scammer and of course I know that Apollo astronauts placed retroreflectors on the Moon which can be used to prove that they went there and that their photos of the spherical Earth are real, because I've done enough research to convince myself.

Gunz combined small-map, counter strike style shooting, with fast paced anime style skill moves and melee combat. You could dash, wall run, block bullets with swords etc.

What made it unique and memorable was that players quickly learned to exploit these mechanics. For example, you could dash forward, block the dash with a guard, jump, dash again, swing your sword, block again, switch to your shotgun, fire off a shot, switch back to your sword and repeat. 

This style of play was discovered by a Korean audience, and so, got dubbed ‘K-Style.’ It quickly became the only way to really survive in Gunz at all. You had to learn a crazy amount of intricate combinations and skill cancels - but if you did, you could jump around off walls and ceilings, deflecting bullets, firing shotguns, and slashing your weapon, all in one fluid movement. This made for crazy intricate duels. It also must have brought about early onset arthritis in a lot of people.

The steep learning curve meant that Gunz had a small but hardcore fanbase, but stopped it ever being a mainstream success. The developer quickly developed Gunz 2: The Second Duel in response - removing all of the mechanics that made K style possible.

On one hand, I get their intention, and maybe Gunz would never have been a huge commercial success. On the other, removing K style took out the very thing that made Gunz unique. The second game is just a soulless, dated shooter.

It’s a shame - if they’d embraced the way that their fanbase wanted to play the game, they might have made something special.",810

They were a part of this cult during the early 80’- 90’s (before I was born). The “church” was strict on rules of what to eat, how much money given to the church, marriage etc hence the concern from my family. It came to a head with my dad setting a boundary with his brother saying “you can’t meet my kids until you and your family escape.” (Which hurt my dads family a lot but my aunt and my grandpa agreed it had to be done) I didn’t meet my uncle, his wife or cousins until I was 7 years old.

Exclusive Resorts is an invite-only membership club for very high end travel. They don’t post their prices online, but I know people that work there. They have personal cell phone numbers for people like Jeff Bezos, Waltons, and people that live at that stratospheric titan of industry level.

Their cheapest membership package is $100,000 to join, and can run up to $250,000. That’s just the price to join the club. You have to pay for any travel you want to book on top of that. 

They have a $600M portfolio of properties they own throughout the world, that only their members have access to. Want to guarantee availability for a finish-line view villa in Monaco during the Grand Prix? Want to get a ski-in cabin next to the Walton’s cabin in Aspen over Christmas? Want a luxury penthouse in Paris during fashion week? These are your guys. 

They cap their membership at 3,000 people, so you may have to wait for a long time until you can get in.

Another interesting one: White Desert is your tour operator of choice if you want a private expedition with your buddies to the South Pole.

During this sabbatical, his wife and her family talked my dad into putting almost his whole pension into a single stock with her stockbroker nephew. The stock was Venezuelan oil stocks. Maybe you have an idea how volatile the Venezuelan economy is, and how high inflation is there. It’s a bad situation.

Then he needed to sell his house because it was too expensive. But the buyer got cold feet on the last day before the sale. Rather than having the buyer pay 10% of the price to get out of the sale he gave him an extension without an end date. The buyer then took 2 years to think about whether he wanted the house.

On a grander scale, there’s this idea of not letting your children suffer. We all know it’s important to let them struggle a little to learn how to cope. 

But one no one ever talks about is allowing your child to mourn a loss. If a beloved toy breaks, go buy a replacement ASAP! If a pet fish dies, go buy a replacement ASAP! You’re teaching the kid to just replace things they’ve lost instead of processing the loss. So what happens when they lose something that can’t be replaced? They don’t know what to do or how to handle it. Like, let your kid cry over their dead fish for a few days and bury it in the garden with some flowers before asking if they’d like another.

People think it’s small, oh it’s just a toy, but losing a beloved toy is likely the closest thing a kid has to losing a person or a pet they’ve had for years like a dog.

For some people it’s really important, but if it isn’t to you then I think that’s fine. There isn’t one cookie-cutter right way for a healthy and supportive relationship to form, develop, and be maintained. I think our longevity has more to do with both of us constantly working on our communication & self reflection skills, learning to curb our egos or take space (and respect space) when we can’t, and staying together because we want to not because we feel like we have to.

1amhqvu,kpmujuk,"I worked at a newspaper processing obituaries, and it was crazy how much funeral homes tried to rip people off.

Obits are expensive. Like, $400 for a single day expensive. And they are priced by the word. We had funeral homes who would send us obits with all the commas and periods separated to make full new words. The homes would get the estimate from our website and use that for billing the grieving family. We would edit the obit to meet English standards, which would reduce the word count substantially, dropping the price. In other words, they charged for the estimate but got billed for the edit.

It got so bad management told us we were not allowed to talk about prices with family members, even if they came in and showed us the bill from the funeral home. The ""customer"" was the home, not the family, so they weren't privileged to see the pricing.

We had three dogs; two lab mixes and a samoyed mix, so two blacks and one white. Easy to recognize.

Then one day we had to look after a friend's lab because she had to go to a job interview or something, I can't remember why. But this meant there were now three black dogs and one white. They all ran through the house past the sofa table where the cat was lounging. He didn't care about the first lab mix he knew. He didn't care about the samoyed mix. He didn't care about the new lab.

He freaked out when the elderly lab mix he'd known for over ten years walked past him because that was one black dog too many.",3334

Fast forward 14 years, and several cities and continental moves later for me. I’m back home to see family, staying with that sister in her new house for the first time, and my first morning wakeup was from her cat meowing and scratching at MY bedroom door.

When my sister in law came for the first time my wife was not in then room and our dog was immediately super excited to meet her. Master returns level excited and very affectionate.

He has never reacted like that with anyone else before. At first I thought that he mistook her for my wife but he was much quicker than average to accept our parents as well so I think it's a familial smell?",431
12ocf1t,jgiy53y,"My dog had a lot of trauma and abuse before I adopted her, so it takes her a little bit to warm up to new people. EXCEPT with respect to my identical twin.

When the whole family is together, and I leave for a minute, she might get confused for a few moments and think that I’m still there (because she sees my twin) but will realize her mistake and run to find me. Overall, she’s not confused between the two of us but is thrilled to have a second version of me.

Edit: I’m seeing a ton of comments saying that dogs identify people by scent. Which is mostly true, but my dog definitely gets confused when she’s several yards away from me and/or my twin. And my twin’s dog (who loves everyone in the world with equal gusto, cannot say if he was/is more excited to see me) has confidently trotted up to me to hit me up for food or walkies, realized his mistake, and found his mama instead.",253

Since there was so much food, we had plenty of leftover cake for the next few days, which I was only allowed to eat a little bit of. 

When no one was around, I snuck into the kitchen and ate a couple slices of the leftover cake, plus I picked huge chunks of the icing off. It looked pretty haphazard by the time I snuck away again. 

My parents soon found the remains of the cake. Since I'm diabetic, they didn't suspect that it was me who picked at the leftovers (I was usually a very well-behaved kid). They blamed it on our rather chubby cat, and promptly deemed it unacceptable for human consumption. It was a believable scenario because she had stolen human food in the past. Sadly, they threw the rest of the cake out.

I could never own up to it because I would have been in trouble for compromising my blood sugar levels, and for being greedy! My old cat never ratted me out for letting her take the blame, though. Thanks, Molly, R.I.P!



Edit: I'm a woman and this was the year 2000, before the medical technology we have now. Back then, I only checked my blood glucose at mealtimes so the crime wouldn't have been evident until the next morning, and that's only if I was honest about my blood glucose level! There was no such thing as sliding-scale dosage back then so eating more cake was very much a bad idea! Hence only being allowed a little bit.

Edit 2: it was sitting out on the kitchen table and hadn't been wrapped up and put away yet lol. It was butter icing which made the cat theory a bit more believable

Their whole point is that the government ***shouldn't*** collect funds for \[insert governmental function here\] against the will of the taxees.

The ""theft"" claimers didn't *consent* to pay taxes, yet if they don't the gov't will attempt to coerce them into paying taxes in ever-escalating steps until eventually they send some nice young men with guns to \[insert government-imposed consequence here\] them.

Taking a person's belongings from them against their will, especially with the threat of force/imprisonment, is theft by definition. Theft *for a good cause that benefits us all like roads or hospitals or schools* is still theft.

What the money is taken-without-consent *for*, and *who's* doing the taking-without-consent, is irrelevant to whether or not that process is theft.

Despite locals who regularly camped in the area AND indigenous people that LIVED there saying there were many dingo lairs nearby and that the creatures were *extremely* dangerous, they did little to no follow up and she was convicted because the public thought she behaved 'weirdly' after the baby's death by doing things like smiling at a pleasant memory during the memorial. Not only that, she became a laughingstock around the world with the term 'the dingo ate my baby' making it into shows as big as Seinfeld at the time. 

Years later they found a dingo lair with scraps of Azaria's clothes because, shockingly, the people who live and regularly camp in the area actually know more than the police and general public and were correct. She was released from prison and her name was cleared, but she'll have to live the rest of her life knowing her baby was taken from her and the world treated her like a murderous clown.

So, a lot of people asking about lawsuits. Unfortunately, that was not an option. This was a low-income state-sponsored thing that the dentists volunteered for, and part of getting them to volunteer was a no-liability thing. Plus at the time I kind of figured I'd probably explained which tooth wrong rather than him just pulling the wrong one. I'm guessing I probably could have held the state liable, but at the time I was much younger and not very savvy, so I never pursued it.

189tk88,kbtvs15,"My brother is a kazillionaire. I don't know how wealthy he is, but it's a lot of zeroes.

He owns multiple businesses, which he created from scratch. He treats all his employees VERY well. He takes good care of them and their families. They're extremely loyal and have stayed with him for many years. 

As others have mentioned, he is always ON. He is always looking for a new angle. He does business on his cellphone while riding a ski lift. But he does a great job of being in the moment. He can be horsing around with his grandkids, and then, in two minutes of slack time, checks his email and makes a huge business decision, before going back to his grandkids with gusto.

He lives in a beautiful home which, while luxurious and well-appointed, is modest by kazillionaire standards. He and his wife are gracious and generous hosts,  not to show off their property, but to make their guests feel welcome and comfortable. Their guests aren't just fellow kazillionaires, but cover the entire socioeconomic spectrum. 

He doesn't flaunt his wealth. He has an expensive hobby, and he takes his family on expensive vacations, but he doesn't make a big deal of either one. Plus, he invites his brothers on ski trips and such, and all we have to do is show up and have a good time with him. 

The best thing is that he's a silent philanthropist. He very quietly gives away buckets of money. He doesn't brag about it. He just does it. It goes to scout troops, churches, schools, international foundations, single mothers, and the list goes on. I've only found out about his giving indirectly, never from him.

So they did their research and discovered that the best treatment in the country was available in London. A flat in Kew (I think, somewhere fairly central anyway) was rented for the six months the dog would need treatment for and my uncle would stay in it for one week a month while the dog had his treatment, then travel back home for the other three weeks. 

2 - Legal help. Neighbours being pains in the backside? Send in the solicitor. Trying to organise a purchase or sale and it’s taking too long? Pay the solicitor to fast track.

It is easy to forget the cost of things when money is meaningless. When a $500k Ferrari is the financial equivalent to a gallon of milk for most families, then spending $20k on a party that includes private chefs, a bar staff, etc. is nothing. 

What happened recently was that someone mentioned there were a bunch of kids in MS who were getting trained at trade schools for jobs, but the certification exam was $350 so only 2 kids out of the 35 in our pilot program got certified. It was hard for anyone in that room to understand how these families couldn't come up with $350 having a whole year to prepare. Most people in that room bill at $250-$500/hr. if they work at all. 

Two days ago, someone took me out to lunch and the bill was $250, but since it's Christmas season and the waitress was really great, he tipped $250.

A different time, we went out for drinks at the bartender was one of those ""tell me what you like and I'll make you something."" The lady goes to pay and just writes 'math' in the tip line and put $500 on the total for what was less than three drinks a person for four of us. 

On the other hand, there are lots of times when someone says something completely off the wall elitist. I grew up incredibly poor and some of these people are fifth and tenth generation wealth. They grew up with maids and butlers and private planes and their great grandparents have buildings all over the US named after them. 

One time one of them was talking about how she went to Walmart to people watch and never felt unsafe even though it was ""the black part of town."" She tried to ""make some black friends because if she could befriend them then she could educate them on better financial decisions."" It was such a condescending and racist approach we had to council her to never do that again. Another guy says things like ""the blacks will ___ "" and he thinks he's very woke.

Edit just because I’ve responded a few times to comments: my parents are trying so hard and they’re so well meaning but it was hilarious all around. They are also very generous about returns and whatnot, and always have been. I didn’t only get the two things so there was a lot more to enjoy while I laughed some more. They’ve had some hard times recently so they’re a bit stressed and distracted, which makes it harder for them to understand the finer points of my hobby.
Added edit: Something like this happens pretty much every year. My dad always gets some article of clothing that is accidentally comically small or large and for some reason it is impossible to avoid. He got a small tee shirt instead of XL this year which was also hilarious. Years ago he got a pair of 4x pants (how???) and we still laugh about it.

As they day went on I though nothing of it and proceeded continue my work until I was bringing another customers pc to the back to work on and again from my peripheral I could have sworn I saw a bloody body in bound in a trunk of a car. At that moment I began to freak out. I grabbed one of my employees explained to him the situation. We then sat for 10 minutes and watched this screen saver (It is against company policy to search through the clients personal files without absolute just cause.) We then proceeded to see a photo 2 bodies in a shallow grave out in the woods and another photo of a severed hand down in kitchen drawer. I then went and got the general manager and informed him of the situation and had him view this screen saver. We then felt that I would be in everyone's best interest to contact Law Enforcement. In about 15 minutes later owner of the computer and another gentleman show up I proceed to tell him that his computer is not ready and it will be awhile. He then informs me that he was called there because someone reported there was some photographs of a grisly murder that we had found. I showed him his computer and then his partner then begins to laugh at him.

12gb3fs,jflrxof,"The day after my dad died, I laid down and took a long nap. I was exhausted from the visitors and the questions and the reminders that he was gone, so I just wanted to escape for awhile. 

During that nap, I dreamt a strange dream. I was back in the hospital again and I saw my dad surrounded by doctors and hooked to all kinds of wires and IVs. I cried and told them to leave him alone and that he had suffered enough, but my dad told me not to cry, and it was then that I noticed they were actually removing the wires and IVs from him. He stood up, which was something he hadn’t done in a long time, and asked me to walk with him. 

He was wearing a long white robe and together we walked through a beautiful place next to a stream. I was telling him about how we had seen the Avengers recently and how his favorite superhero, The Hulk, had been in it. I laughed as I explained the scene where Hulk slams Loki around like a rag doll and said, “Oh my god. That would have been your favorite part. You would have died laughing.” My dad said, “Poor choice of words,” but he was smiling. I said, “Yeah, true. Sorry dad.”

His smile went away and then he looked at me seriously, and said, “It’s alright. You know, I didn’t really want to die.”

…and then I woke up. I had tears streaming down my face, and to this day I have never had another dream like that again. I’ve always been skeptical of the unknown but sometimes I wonder if he was saying goodbye to me in the only way he could. I still miss him every day of my life.

Some guy that lives across the street turned out to have been stalking me and decided to climb through my bedroom window. He took nothing valuable. Just some weird personal items. It was terrifying to walk in and see my things rummaged through. It was even scarier when I talked to the neighbor and they admitted that multiple people in the neighborhood had seen it happen, but they were all too scared of ol’ dude to say anything. The weirdest part of it all (and I mean this guy took some *creepy* personal things) is that nagging feeling I had before I found the remnants of the break in.

My three companions went to the store around sundown. While alone in a dimly lit house, the phone rang. When I answered, a voice said in a slow, quiet whisper “…it’s allllll yourrrrr faullllt….”.  

What ran through my brain in an instant was how boring my life had been to this point, and this was probably the most exciting thing that has ever happened to me. Like something you see on TV or in the movies. And in a flash my excitement blurted out as “far OUT!!!!”. Then they hung up.",368

The first time I brought my now husband home, my dad was courteous but distant. Miraculously, by the second time my father literally gushed all over my husband. Even my siblings were shocked. When we got married, he was beaming. It was odd, but I was just happy my husband had won him over. 

My mom died in 2014 and my father in 2021. When my siblings and I went to clean out the house, in his safe along with other important documents, we found letters that my husband had written to my father 24 years before about how he felt about me, how he was serious about his relationship with me, how he was planning to go to law school (he did, he's an attorney now) how he respected that he'd gone through so much in his lifetime, and eventually how he loved me and how with his blessing, he was going to propose. My husband never told me he'd written my father and my father never told me he'd been corresponding with my husband. It was so emotional finding those. I still tear up when I think about it. When I got home, my husband finally showed me the letters my father had written back.",13917

On the back of the card, there were 21 lines written in pencil. Each year, my grandpa would write on the back of the card the date and the year of his new birthday. With a different small note beside it each year. Like, “miss you terribly this time”, or “you would have liked the weather today”.

They wanted to be together again but didn't want to put their kids and grandkids through a reconciliation until they were confident it'd work out. 

I knew she'd be devastated, they had been together almost thirty years, but they were two years divorced and casually seeing other people. They seemed to be thriving apart. So it was a shock when the grief was so strong that it took all the life out of her. She died of cancer, but the doctor also diagnosed her with Failure to Thrive brought on by the loss of my dad, and said that it may have been possible for her to live longer and even receive treatment if the Failure to Thrive hadn't taken everything she was before her cancer diagnosis.

We also learned he was autistic. He had strict routines and went through special education, and noted everything he did in a day. As an autistic person diagnosed as an adult and struggling, it was kind of a beautiful thing to see. He had it together in his way. And everybody he knew liked him.

We made friends with his neighbours and stay in contact. Post humously he gave us memories and relationships, and every once in a while as we manage his affairs and look at the pots and pans we brought back to replace our broken ones we say, ""Thanks, [uncle name].""",261

A couple times, I pointed out that she needed to be committed. He always responded that a person couldn't be committed unless they're a danger to themselves or others. True, but she obviously was. I was terrified of her. Even apart from the breakdowns, she threw rage attacks at the drop of a hat.

Long story short, in my 20s I found out that A) they'd had two kids before me, and B) she'd drowned them in a bathtub during a psychotic episode. What I never found out was how she gor released or why she was able to conceive me less than a year later.

A friend was with me when I found out about B). He told me later that he'd always thought I was exaggerating when I said I'd feared for my life as a kid. I couldn't blame him, it does sound outlandish.

He went in, checked her TV which had never been on (she had one of those big ones from the 90s that would get warm when turned on), the radio hadn’t been on either (figured maybe it was the beat of a song or something). After that, we heard the footsteps a bunch of times, usually very early in the morning. Some of the footsteps were so heavy, they’d shake the ceiling fan of the dining room directly under her bedroom and they’d woken her up a few times as well 

Whenever I’d shower at my dads, I always felt like someone was standing behind me. Eventually, I got so stressed and paranoid that I refused to shower at the house or even go into the upstairs bathroom. My dad asked me one day “do you ever feel like someone’s in the shower with you when you’re here?” After months of me feeling that way and never mentioning it to anyone",9845

There are tons of stories but the one I experienced myself was when I was living there as a child. I was about 6 yo and my older sister was 12 and we shared a room. My mom had decorated our bedside table with an antique telephone that didn’t work and was not plugged in. My sister and I were asleep and for some reason we both woke up at the same time and turned to face each other. I remember feeling an extreme feeling of dread. Then the phone rang in between us. We locked eyes and both hid under our blankets til it stopped ringing. We both thought it was a dream because we didn’t say anything for years about it, then one day she was talking about it and we realized we had had the exact same experience. 

There are so many more stories but that’s the only one I experienced directly.",4492

1. Smell

2. Both intelligence and stupidity of ppl

4. Actual military firepower and the vast ability to wipe out areas if wanted to (tbh, this would be a much easier virus to contain vs something like COVID. You can actually “kill” this virus with air strikes or even just bullets. You can’t do that with traditional virus and disease)

Edit: this concept of “nobody is trained for headshots” is not an answer to any of these points. Bones, muscle and tissue simply cannot operate when they are damaged. Trauma from weapons (whether they are explosive, projectile, blunt force, etc) can immobilize and render motor functions useless. When you shoot the legs and knees of a horde of zombies, yeah they aren’t “dead” but they are significantly less mobile and less of a threat which allows more lethal finishes significantly easier. 

Besides, ppl seem to forget point 3 anyway, which IMO is the most important. Nothing can beat nature. The simple decaying process renders dying/rotting meat a moot threat",756

I really liked this coworker,  I remember her as one of the nicest people I've ever known.  I asked her what was wrong and she said that her wages were going to be cut substantially.  She stated that the store manager was told by corporate that since she was not able to work as fast as others in the back doing pricing.  I asked if she would mind if I asked what they had cut it to and she said $3.30 an hour.  

WTF!

It turns out that goodwill has a policy that they can pay workers a ""sub-minimal"" wage. 

 This was pulled from a charity site on Google showing the policy:

Sec 14 (c) allows corporations to pay people with disabilities a subminimum wage. According to Labor Department records, Goodwill pays some of its disabled workers as low as 22, 38 and 41 cents per hour.

Sometime around 2008ish, they (like many other hardware/software companies) were messing around with what was essentially adware, seeing how far they could push things to get borderline-malicious advertising onto your home computer. Stuff like the pile of CDs that came with your new Gateway, the ""do you also want to install X, Y and Z? We're going to imply it's necessary"" when installing messaging apps, or the huge unnecessary printer ""software suite"" when all you needed was the driver.

LG went a step further: they embedded adware *in the firmware* of their CD/DVD drives. Every X times you opened or closed the drive, you'd get a little popup from your system tray that served you an ad--pretty much indistinguishable from the legions of adware/spyware your aunt would get from clicking ""yes"" to all her popup ads.

Except nobody clicked yes on anything, and it couldn't be removed. It was embedded in the drive itself, essentially performing an AutoPlay exploit on a virtual drive to show you the ads, then disappear again.

They eventually were threatened with legal action and had to post a firmware update/removal tool on their website.

The ad software was called BlueBirds, and LG scrubs all mentions of it from their Wikipedia article every now and then.",4752

But being a lifelong R and in a R state, I voted for Trump.

I left the President blank in 2020. 

I will be voting against Trump --even if it means voting for a D-- in 2024.

Why... Trump promised to end the deficit. Instead he increased it in his first budget. 

Trump promised to limit government power. Instead he tried to increase the power of the President. 

Plus his moral failings. 

Then, after the election, he spread lies about Democracy, and led the insurrection. 

Trump is a hardcore bad guy in the story of American Democracy and American freedom. 

I am glad Trump happened. It forced me to examine the Republican Party. I was able to realize that there are good and moral and ethical Democrats. Just like there are a small number of Republicans who are good and ethical humans. 

I still support gun rights.

But I want abortion to be safe, legal, and rare. The ramifications are a woman having to report a miscarriage when abortion isn't legal. Thats not a small-government limited-government ideal. 

But now I can see that we need to worry about the environment, civil rights, and police have way, way too much power. 

If a patient dies on a doctors table, with the doctor trying to save the patient, the doctor is investigated and can lose their license. A police officer kills a suspect through obvious error, and nothing happens. That can't all work like that if our democracy is going to work. Police in the US has far far too much power. 

Trump had stacks of Police guarding the white house during BLM in 2020. But none when the House and Senate were to ratify the 2020 election. That is an obvious statement on Trumps part. When -Trump- feared armed police were stacked deep. With Democracy on the line, Trump limited the police.",691

For a lot of faiths, in particular in Catholic doctrine (though I believe Islam has a similar mindset), sex is not a bad thing, **however** sex has a specific use and purpose. It is done explicitly with your spouse, and primarily for the purposes of having children. (I’m sure there are nuances involving the intimacy of a spousal relationship and sex deepening that bind but I’m less familiar with that bit.)

As a result, these faiths are very kid-positive. So therefore in addition to the beliefs that an egg could count as human life (and therefore birth control can fall in a similar jurisdiction as abortions), and using contraceptives can be seen as denying that purpose to sex.

Now there are complexities to that and pragmatism and given that not many people are having 8 kids anymore, I suspect it’s not **tightly** followed. But if you want an academic, genuine reasoning, that’s the reason.",555

All we could do is interact with each other and play established games like marbles or maybe an organized sport like Little League baseball.  There was a baseball diamond, overgrown with weeds, across the street from us, but mostly we played in the woods that surrounded us, climbing trees pretending to be pirates or some such.  I loved the bookmobiles that would visit my street, and I must have read every biography (all bound in blue covers) in my elementary school library.  It was a different era with many fewer distractions and much more time for sustained imagination.  Being a different place and time, we developed different skills for interacting with the world and each other than young people do today.  Was it better?  That's hard to say.  We tended to have an insular view of our own little world, while today it is hard to escape what it happening everywhere on Earth.  We had to wait days for a letter to arrive, and we shared a party line with our neighbor's phone.  That is a far slower pace than today's instantaneous texting culture.  (Yes, I do text.)

Some employers also required married women to have their husband's permission before they were offered employment.  

When people talk about how women in the 1950s and 1960s stayed married even when the marriage was clearly rocky, it was less about devotion and more to do with the lack of equal access to education, work and finances.

It hurt like hell, and definitely was not comfortable at all at any point. You just cannot not feel it.

 When I lived in the UK, I either had to spend a smaller fortune on buying OB tampons from various sites on the internet or ask someone to bring me some when they were visiting a country that had them, as they're not being sold in the UK. I tried several other brands, including Lidl and drugstores'  own brands, and while OB was the best in my opinion, most were not as uncomfortable as Tampax was besides a few.

During one of my early fights with my GF (now wife of 15 years) I was surprised that even though she was still mad, she clearly said ""I'm upset when you did X, because of (something in her past). I know that past event is not your fault, but I'm still feeling some kind of way, we should talk later after I've processed a bit.""

Wayyyyy different than my past relationship.  No silent treatment, no hiding emotions and exploding later, firm about feelings while taking accountability,  honest apologies...its great.  We still have conflicts, and even yell from time to time, but they are productive in the end.

But what is you? Are ""you"" just an interface for all these individual cells to find and input building blocks for their survival? Would ""we"" be a more accurate term for what ""you"" are? Do cells even have their own self?

Or is the ""you"" a seperate entity entirely, simply being in charge of a small piece of nature for the time being? If so, where does that external self originate from?

16voaud,k2sdmt9,"I'm 40, I don't have kids.

4 years ago I moved to a new place and befriended my neighbour, he has 1 daughter from a previous relationship, his girlfriend has 2 more (also from a previous relationship).

They both used to work shifts, so they needed a babysitter for the two daughters of his gf, the other girl would go to her mom's place, as she lives really close.

One year ago,  they couldn't find a babysitter for 3 days, and I had to pick up these 2 girls ( 5 and 8 years old at the time), from school, help them with homework, have them shower, make them dinner and then put them to bed.

They already knew me of course as I often hang out with their mother and my neighbour, but I've never kept them alone.

I had the best of times. They were a blast. Lovely, kind, would not talk back or make a scene.

Nowadays they're 7 and 9(nearly 10). I often go to their place and the youngest gives me the biggest hugs, then just sit on my lap while the oldest just sit next to me, and both will tell me about their day and talk about random stuff. We do lots of activity together and I'm now more like an uncle than just the neighbour. And I love it. I feel loved, I feel appreciated, It just feels... nice.

That feeling there, is what is lost when you don't have a kid. I think it's surely the only ""pro"" of having a kid.

Editing because of many comments: The goal is NOT to compare ""parenting"" and ""being an uncle"".  OF COURSE being a parent is different and has many downsides. THAT. IS. NOT. THE. POINT. OF. THE. POST.

The point is:

""what's the con of not having kids? ""> ""the con is that you may miss of these good feelings kids give you when you take care of them""

He was born to a wealthy Parisian family in 1848. His father owned a textile business that he later inherited. He was an artist in his own right, but became much more known as a supporter of the arts. Fearful he'd die young, he writes in his will that the French state accept his large art collection (today valued at several billion dollars) and hang art from several impressionist artists, who were friends of his, in a national museum upon his death.

Caillebotte dies young (45) in 1894 as he predicted and so his will attempts to be executed. The French government initially refuses the request. Pundits and critics, from art to politics, view the request as absurd and publicly say how repulsed they are by the collection itself. Several art professors from Ecole des Beaux-Arts threaten to resign if the government enacts the will.

In the end, half of Caillebotte's art collection gets hung in 1897 at the Musee du Luxemborg and the public comes out in droves to visit the gallery because of all the press Caillebotte's request had received after his death. People wanted to see this ""ugly art.""

The artists featured? Their names were Monet, Renoir, Degas, Cezanne, Manet, Pissarro, and Sisley.

It's very possible these artists would never have become the household names they are today had Caillebotte not liked the ugly, unsellable art that a few of these friends of his made.",2422

Patient was healthy 50-something year old who had an extended nosebleed after a long hike. It wouldn’t stop so they went to ER to get it cauterized/impacted (happens all the time). Anyway, they did a CT scan as protocol and discovered she had a 20+ cm tumor on her uterus that was wrapping around her right kidney; she was immediately referred to a serious academic hospital and had a specialized oncology surgeon remove it.

Amazingly? They got it completely removed without even having to damage the kidney. She had an amazing outcome and about a half a foot scar running around her abdomen from the surgery.

Edit for clarification: I do not believe the CT scan was due to the nosebleed itself but rather I imagine as they looked further into her blood work and coagulation studies they found something that warranted further work up.",5777

I had a doctor appointment, just a 6 month checkup for my diabetes. My heart rate was up, so my doctor sent me to the ER for blood work. Turns out I was having a weird version of diabetic ketoacidosis where my blood sugar wasn't elevated (anion gap). They kept me in ICU for a week.

My mom went to her doctor for shortness of breath. He told her she was old and overweight. We took her to the ER, where they drained a couple of liters of fluid off her lungs.

Had post-concussion syndrome, and already had a MRI done. It was nothing out of the ordinary. Then one day about a month later, I got up and suddenly fainted. Consulted my doctors, and they all agreed it was likely a one-off and I was fine to go travel… but they still thought, to be on the safe side, I should do another MRI scan when I returned. 

I had a great few weeks travelling, and that included lots of outdoors and sports stuff. Then I came back, and went for my scan, this time with contrast. By that point, I honestly felt like I was wasting time and money. 

So imagine my shock when the results came out and I was told I had a brain tumour. I later found out that people with the type of brain tumour I am suspected to have tend to have it manifest through seizures. I just happened to have mine in a “dead area”, so I just never had any symptoms at all.

I was hit harder than most (almost didn't get on our flight home because I was worried about having to use the bathroom if the seatbelt sign was on or if there was a line up). Ultimately got home. Everyone in the group (about 12 people) were feeling better, but I was still having some minor gastro issues. Nothing crazy, still working and living normal life. Went to a walk in because my family doc couldn't see me for at least 2 weeks. Walk in doc ordered some tests and prescribed an antibiotic. I got a call the test came back negative, but if I was still feeling unwell, to come back (this was like 2 weeks after my first visit). I debated, but decided to go back, turns out they never ran the e coli test, so they run that again. Doc said she'll call me when the results were in. 

I didn't hear back, but my now MIL (a doc) caught wind I was still dealing with gastro issues and asked if she could call the lab to get my results. I said ""sure, that would be great"". 

In the meantime, a friend is visiting from out of town and I wanted to show her a good time, so we went out dancing. At some point in the evening my now MIL had called me something like 17 times, leaving voice mails and texts to get to the hospital asap. Don't go home to change, don't get public transit (IE cab because it'll be faster), just go STRAIGHT to the hospital. 

The nurses were absolutely FLOORED the e coli hadn't gotten into my blood stream (this was about a month after our trip). Apparently my urine test came back absolutely overrun with an antibiotic resistant e coli. 

Best part, the walk in doc fiiiiiiinally called me about a week after my hospital visit telling me she has the results and I should come see her. My MIL happened to be standing beside me when I received the call and asked to talk to the doc. As a teacher at the university here, the walk in doc knew who she was and had to walk my MIL through my case to identify ALL the ways she let me down as a patient (including asking me to come into the clinic instead of rushing to the hospital).

An ER doc was running some baby docs through training when a disheveled man in an old rumpled suit, obviously homeless, came in complaining of nonspecific malaise. Kept mumbling about quantum whatever under his breath. Wasn't all there, mentally.

She thought he was drug seeking, but opted to run him through basic diagnostics to show the baby docs how it was done. Turns out the dude was in full blown kidney failure. They put him on dialysis and he just *snaps* into focus. Complete turnaround, 100% coherent.

Turns out dude was an actual professor and expert on quantum mechanics and was riding a train to a conference when he entered kidney failure. It addled his brain and he wandered off the train at a random stop in a state of confusion. He'd been roaming the streets for months like that. Somehow didn't die.

Of course, they tore my car apart and found absolutely nothing as I don’t do drugs, drink, or take any medications beyond the occasional multivitamin. I’m in law enforcement and know that many, MANY police officers train in a backdoor signal to drug K9s that manufacture probable cause to search. They might tap a couple of times or say a code word and the dog will “hit” whenever they do. Nothing ever came of the stop, after 6 cruisers, 8 officers, and a K9. All because I refused a search and politely refused to answer any questions. After the stop was over I was issued a warning for 37 in a 35.

He asked if he could search my truck. My truck was a tiny 2-seater; if we'd stole anything, there was no place to hide it. I said for what reason? He just asked to search it again, and I said no. He could see that my buddy was still wearing his work clothes.  Cop came back and gave me a ticket for having a clear license plate cover (they were legal at the time), but said it was cloudy and obstructing my plate. Obviously looking for something to punish me for.

So a guy named Gray Horsefield (great name) took home a workstation over the 2002 holiday break and re-animated the entire tower collapse himself so it didn't look so depressingly familiar.

There was talk of nationalized healthcare, gay rights, and fairer pay. Despite a person's fears or perception of differences the world felt like a nicer place and on a world wide pace of changing everyone's lives for the better. 

All of that ground to a screeching halt. Everything else took a back burner for the drums of war as the disease of paranoia, xenophobia, or bigotry slowly set in. The helpfulness and hopefulness in the days and months afterward transformed into something different entirely. For as much as 9/11 brought people together in the immediate aftermath it ultimately tore us apart.

The perception of safety and the veil of preparedness were utterly destroyed that day. 9/11 is a sliver in the minds of multiple generations that put a collective mark on all of us that witnessed it or lost someone that day. We all lost something whether it was simply innocence or naivete that day. We all lost something whether tangible or intangible. We all lost something.",606

She had drank so heavily for so long she developed a neurological disorder which left her debilitated.

She gradually lost her balance, her motor skills and coordination, and is now hospitalized and unable to care for herself.

She is almost a decade younger than me and her life of independence is over.  She will remain bed ridden and rely on others for her most basic needs for the remaining years of her life.

Smoking is responsible for the highest number of preventable deaths.

Beyond that, it also lowers your quality of life badly. It increases your risk of a host of diseases  and complicates many many others. 
Aside from lung cancer, it aggravates the risk of cervix, colon, skin, esophagus, larynx, liver, mouth and throat, pancreatic, stomach, and leukemia cancers.

It’s awful for your risk of stroke, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. It accelerates bone breakdown. It can weaken your immune system and increase your risk of infection. It can aggravate auto immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

And, of course, it just beats the hell out of your lungs. COPD can reduce your quality of life to nearly nothing. You wind up wheelchair bound, dragging an oxygen tank around, and essentially leaving the house only to check into the hospital every few weeks for a severe exacerbation.

It is also known to cause type 2 diabetes, and all the crap that entails.

Vascular disease means poor wound healing, even in the absence of diabetes; impotence; activity intolerance; blindness, etc.

And most of these risks are observable at levels as low as a quarter pack (5 cigarettes) daily.

Studying as a healthcare professional goes something like this: ""oh this illness? who has a predisposition for it? you'll never guess!""

Some of you have probably heard of the Troubled Teen Industry (TTI).  In a nutshell, thousands of children are sent against their will to abusive facilities because their parents believe they require behavioral adjustments.  These facilities go by varied ideologies boot camps, behavior modification facilities, wilderness therapy, drug rehab (this is just a cover…even if you’ve never done drugs they’ll accept the child under the false pretense they are saving them from “future behavior”.  However, they’re all marketed to parents, who are often the root of the family’s problem, as a miracle cure which will ensure an obedient outcome.  I was tricked into visiting one of these programs by my mother when I was 14.  I was far from a bad kid, I was simply an unwanted leftover from a precious marriage who was unloved and made the family scapegoat.  The reason I’m responding to the thread’s question is that the idea can be so foreign to some that they cannot even wrap their heads around the concept.  Especially so if they’ve grown up in a loving environment.  I was subjected to physical, mental and sexual abuse while I was held for 2 years in a warehouse located in an industrial park outside a large metropolis.  One of the most evil aspects was In order for you to advance in the program and hopefully leave it one day was you were expected to inflict these indignities on the other children.  It not only victimizes children, it instills them with a deep shame.  It also makes support group participation that much more difficult because your fellow captives are also your abusers.

 I hope you’ll forgive the length of this post.  Ironically, the need for a long intro is at the center of what I’m wanting to communicate though—I could literally explain what the experience was like for 2 weeks straight, and I’d probably only scratch the surface of what its like to loose all of your rights and freedoms, to be subjected to brainwashin, tortured at the whim of the programs facilitators and other children/captives, to live in constant fear all day, every day for years without hope of escape.  I denied it all happened until I was in my forties.  I’ve learned to be very selective about who I share the topic with because people, without meaning to, can respond in ways which can be triggering,  I think think this also speaks to the spirit of this thread:  how can they be expected to respond if they are likely unaware of what the experience was really like, or might be completely unaware that it’s even happening at all in the US today?  Thank you for reading—I appreciate these moments when I get to express both the experience and also hopefully spread awareness, ultimately exposing these privatized child prisons for hire.",677

Freddie Mercury did not leave the band to make a solo record while under the bad influence of some gay Svengali only to get diagnosed with AIDS and get back together with the boys for their stellar Live Aid performance. 

The band never broke up before Live Aid. In fact I know someone who seen them tour a couple of months before Live Aid. He wasn't even the first guy in the band to have a solo record. He didn't perform at Live Aid knowing he was going to die because he didn't actually get his diagnosis until almost 2 years later which is also around the time when he got around to firing Paul Prenter.

Also the portrayal of Freddie as a gay man feels like some weird throwback to the 1980s when all gay characters in movies for portrayed as sad, conflicted and persecuted. He was a good looking superstar who by all accounts thoroughly enjoyed his ridiculously opulent hedonistic lifestyle.

We used to rent games together at a game place when we were teens. I went in one day without Bob and the guy(Mike owns and runs it) says the account is under Bob. If you're the other guy you'll have to set up another account. He asked ""you're Bob , aren't you?"" 


I said yes(small white lie) got the game to rent and told Bob the story later.


We spent the next few years talking to the owner all the time and the owner saying goodbye Bob to me. The place closes down and the lie ends there(yay, it had gone on for too long)


4 years later, I'm married and we go and pick up something from an electronic store. And there's Mike, he runs over and shakes me hand and says ""How's life Bob "". He tells one of his employees that I kept his store alive with all the games me and my mate bought and rented. He complained to misses Bob, where was his invite to the wedding. He gave me and my confused wife a 20% discount and we went on our way. 


10 years later, I needed a computer piece, I took my 2 & 4 year old kids with me and went to computer parts store. And low and behold, there was mike, he says long time no see Bob. My kids are confused but are shy, so they are quiet. Mike gives me a free upgrade on the hard drive I was buying.

My wage is the same as the wage of the supervisor role they want me to take. Inconceivable.

EDIT: Since this is getting quite a few comments, I will address some of the questions that appear the most.

I work in IT (specifically IT networking and am currently a NOC tech for those that care for details). 

My current job is as a contractor for a U.S. Federal agency (it's not the one you are thinking of...no not that one either, stop guessing). On top of that, I'm a sub-contractor, so I get paid more than my co-workers (I don't why it's like that). 

Wages are capped based on the contract with the government, and while these companies do not tell the employees what the cap is (because they can, and do, pay below the cap and keep the difference), we can sometimes figure out where the cap is. I know I'm currently at my wage cap which also happens to be the same (slightly less) than the cap of the supervisor role.

Why not take the role for my resume and get a better job in a year? I did 10 years in the military and was a supervisor for some of that time. I was miserable. Can I be a good supervisor, sure. Do I like being a supervisor, no.  Also, in IT, a person can focus on being a technician and continue up that path in a career and never move into management (my current plan) and make a decent living.",12116

For example, “giving birth naturally.”   Some people seem to think that before modern obstetrics, that we were all just a bunch of natural goddesses giving birth in the forest.  But the reality was a lot more grotesque than that.  If everyone gave birth the way we did in 1900, we would be seeing a lot more childbirth related death.  We would also see a lot more women dealing with fistulas, and being ostracized 

Same with vaccines.  Letting “nature” take its course, killed us, sometimes at alarming rates (like with smallpox).  Oh sure, they had natural immunity to a lot of things, just like we develop natural immunity to a lot of things - except some immunities are a lot safer to get naturally.

He came home, in his twenties, from the army I think. I don't remember much about him, but he asked about taking my older brothers camping, but my mom said no, she had a weird feeling about him. (Side note, we lived out in in the country, not even a town, just a place). There were no locked doors, everyone trusted each other.

 My mom saw him at our little store with bee stings all over and was concerned . He said he got them at the creek. She thought that was weird, because that's just not a thing where we went all the time, but okay? 

A little while later (not sure how long), the news said there was a murder of some campers out past where we lived, no leads. People were shocked - this doesn't happen here!  My mom remembered her weird feeling and the bee stings that didn't make sense. She called the police to say, hey, probably nothing, but here's what I got. I remember detectives coming to our house to talk to her. 

They had some other evidence that matched, but not enough to link him to the murder (a couple with their child). It's unsolved to this day, though the detective said he knew it was him. A few years later, the guy went to prison for an abduction/attempted murder of a woman who ran out of gas and he offered her a ride. She lived, thank god.",5081

One of my mates remained sober to drive us back home. We went to the parking lot and I could hear a voice whimmering somewhere in the dark. I turned around and saw 2 guys carrying a girl to a car. I got closer and now I could hear her voice. She obviously was drunk but she repeated ,,no,, and ,,I don't want,, over and over. Adrenaline kicked in and I became sober instantly. I screamed at them and immediately called the police. I wasn't fast enough so they could get in the car and drive off. But I saw the license plate, gave it to the woman I talked to at the police station and they informed me about 10 minutes later that they arrested the two guys. The whole scene was so terrifying.

They just so happened to rob the place in a 30 minute window when myself, my brother and the people upstairs were out. This means they were watching us for a couple days and monitoring our patterns.

In many Western cultures, being outgoing, sociable, and outspoken is often celebrated and encouraged. It's seen as the norm to want to chat, network, and be the life of the party. But when it comes to introverts who may crave quiet, solitude, or just less social interaction, the script flips.

It’s socially acceptable to nudge the quiet person in the room and say, ""Why don't you talk more?"" But imagine telling a chatty person, ""Can you be quiet for a bit?"" It would be considered rude or offensive.

This double standard underscores a deeper societal bias towards extroversion. The noise and buzz of constant interaction are often valued more than the quiet, reflective spaces introverts thrive in. It's like we're saying one way of interacting with the world is better than the other, when in reality, both have their strengths and should be equally respected.

We came across a small area kind of hidden through an archway of bushes. Inside the area and underneath an overhanging tree, really secluded and off of any kind of path, we found a shallow dug rectangle grave shape with black, burned marks inside on the dirt. I remember my Grandmother just saying ""ok let's go home"" and we went home.

Later on I heard my Grandad confirming with my Grandmother that it would have been the spot where the guy tried to burn the body of a girl who had been recently murdered in their town. The case had been solved but the crime scene must have just been left as that hole.

I pointed him to the next street over, and he asked me to get in the car with him. Luckily I was right by my backyard, so I cut through the bushes and beelined it inside.

She couldn’t drive or have her own cell phone, so she has a designated driver that would pick up/drop off at specific time. Apparently her driver is a weirdo/groomer, bc he wouldn’t stop bothering her and has offered her money for sex. (I didn’t know this until drama happened and she vented to me)

One day when I was at work, this old guy came inside desperately wanting to see her, she goes hiding and tells me to tell the guy to leave. Which I did, then he tries to brute force his way but fails miserably, then he leaves a message on a napkin for her and left. I did read the message and I clearly remember it “I need an answer now, I’m offering you $1500 to run away with me”. I gave it to her, she didn’t read it. A few days later, the girl quits without notice. 

Oh the creepy part, he would show up around 10am at the restaurant looking for her and I keep warning the guy to leave. He eventually stopped after a few weeks.

Edit: I honestly didn’t believe this would blow up, and I mentioned the guy being the groomer, I wanna add she’s not the only victim. Apparently there was one more girl who is a minor and she was facing the same issue as the girl(the girl venting to me or co worker).

I had a house in East Cleveland, OH to inspect that was a huge old mansion but completely abandoned for years and utterly trashed. I had to inspect and photograph every room, looking for any damage.  Basically the entire house was damaged, holes punched in walls, trash everywhere, mold, used needles, feces etc. 

So I get to the basement which was mostly unfinished, and there is one door all the way at the other end.  I swear I hear music playing.  I open the door and there’s a perfectly preserved office with high end stained wood judges paneling on the walls, a plaster ceiling, and fancy old carpeting all in perfect condition.  In the center of the room is a huge old bankers style desk with a huge leather office chair behind it.  On the desk is an old fashioned radio from probably the 1950s or so and it is playing some AM radio station with big band music on.  There’s the radio playing and a lamp turned on in the room, and as far as I knew the house was supposed to not have power turned on.

The commander says that it is part of his plan, and he knew that the general wouldn’t be on board with it if he asked first.

The commander then informs the general that he will go before the king of the enemy city, and claim that the general did this to him, and that he would like to betray said general for this mutilation. The commander then told the general to send his weakest men to a specific place so that the commander, leading the enemy forces could win a “major victory” solidifying his place with the enemy city. 

The commander would then take over watch of one of the gates, and simply let in the general’s army.

Search - it’s a mess. If I want an answer, I need to add Reddit to my search. There are no more finding relevant info from unique sites. Every result is branded seo stuff to filter you to some big entity in the space. It just isn’t good at what it’s supposed to do. The chat AIs are only a threat to Google because search is so clearly just a money maker now, and not useful at all. 

YouTube - it’s a mess. Its search functions are almost worse than search, shorts are so annoying, ads get longer and longer. The way they compensate content creators kills the content. Easy example: I followed a channel of a guy who did these long video series, where he’d play a game and wax philosophical. It made them very popular and beloved in his niche. Now he only makes 5-10 minute quick videos released rapidly. He was asked why, and he said that the algorithms reward shorter content, posting more often. Longer videos just don’t get promoted (probably because the ad ratios get lower).

Not sure he actually believes all of it but he did a DNA test in the first place to try and claim to be native. 

That whole side of my gene pool is into weird religious stuff. Plus the guy he thought was his father isn't.

It was quite obvious as he got older, too, being blonde, blue eyed, skinny, and a high academic achiever vs. being overweight with dark hair, brown eyes, and not-so-academic like his five older siblings.

""Dad"" died fifteen years ago and never had a good relationship with my hubby because he didn't care to invest much in a kid that wasn't his.  Last December during my pregnancy, we decided it was time for him to do 23andMe so he could have some proof in hand before connecting with his mother's AP, alleged bio-dad.

Then, a couple years later, I got a message on there from a woman who matched 28% DNA with me!  After some back and forth, we concluded that we have the same bio dad.  She's only one month younger than me. She was an orphan who was adopted as a toddler from the Philippines and the only background the orphanage gave her was that her bio dad was in the US military and that her bio mom was a very young bar hostess. My dad was in the navy up until I was a baby, and my parents actually split back when I was a teenager because dude cheated on my mom and got another woman pregnant.

13wn5c3,jmdo0vq,"“Beurer BR60 Insect Sting and Bite Relief.” It’s a little gadget that you push up against a mosquito/bug bite, press a button, and it gets really hot for a couple seconds. It’s more effective at reducing the intensity, size, and itchiness of mosquito bites than literally anything else I’ve tried. It works because the heat will denature the proteins that cause irritation and because the heat helps with the swelling/inflammation too. The fast you use it after a bite, the more effective it will be, and if you catch it early enough it can even nearly eliminate the reaction to a bite, but even if you don’t use it soon after, it’ll help bites feel a lot better for a bit. 

When I moved across the country, my immune system did *not* like the mosquitos in the new area, and would react strongly to any bites. I’d get golfball sized bites that left bruises for weeks. I avoided going outside for fear of bites, and the bites I did get got in the way of sleeping well or enjoying things.

I was just out of highschool and wasn't looking to date anyone with kids. With how disrespectful he was during our date, finding out that he had a kid was an automatic deal breaker for me.

While rounding what we thought would be a secluded corner my friend pulled out a joint and went to light up, the noise of the lighter sparking caused something up the trail to turn around quickly... I couldn't tell what it was right away because the lighting was dappled from trees above and it was colored the same as the trail and rock.

I grabbed my friends arm and quietly said stop, stand up, don't turn around, walk backwards slowly... about 30 feet in front of us was a cougar. Easily bigger than any dog I've ever seen, save a great dane or bernese, but the musculature on it was otherworldly compared to any dog. It wasn't crouched like it was going to come for us, it was turned halfway with it's back arched, the way a housecat sizes up another housecat before they fight.

We backed up staring at the thing for what felt like forever, but was only probably 3-4 seconds before it realized we weren't coming towards it anymore and turned tail. It bounded up what I thought was a sheer 20-foot cliff with such ease it made my mind truly spin at the power of nature and thankful I wasn't asked to test it.

At about a quarter of the distance there is a little river crossing the track with a sloping riverside path. The doggie loved to run ahead and jump straight in the water. On this day however, we did not hear the usual splashing sounds so we went a little faster.

Well, we found the dog on the riverside path, with her nose deep between the buttcheeks of a completely naked man, who happened to take his no less naked female acquaintance in missionary there.

After I suddenly went blind in my left eye and got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, I connected the dots.

Edit: Facial twitches are normal! Just because you have twitches often doesn't mean you have a problem, especially if you don't have any other reason to believe you have multiple sclerosis or any other disease.

18urxvw,kfoiido,"Everybody misunderstands how drugs like Adderall treat ADHD. You always hear people claiming that if a neurotypical person takes it, it hypes them up, whereas if somebody with ADHD takes it, it calms them down. This is wrong. People with ADHD aren't extra hyper. Rather, they act exactly as a neurotypical person would act if devoid of any rewarding stimulus. A regular person wouldn't sit still for long at a desk in an empty room with nothing to do. They would pace in circles and fidget and lose themselves deep in daydreams, because that's what humans do when they're bored.   


People with ADHD are bored a lot more often, because their brain's reward system is broken. They don't get tiny little dopamine hits for completing necessary tasks like the rest of us do. The reward system is everything. Without the rush of happy chemicals from sex, nobody would breed. Hunger might suffice to compel one to eat, but we would all be undernourished if food didn't taste good and if our brains didn't give us a hit of happy chemicals for eating something tasty.   


Doing your homework or some necessary adulting doesn't give a fraction of the dopamine hit as getting laid, but it's still something. But if you have ADHD, it's basically nothing. You don't complete your tasks because you literally have no incentive. You fidget and get distracted because your brain is telling you there is literally nothing else to do.   


What drugs like Adderall do is make the reward system generate a whole lot more happy chemicals. Enough that someone with ADHD is suddenly incentivized to do one's work. (Neurotypicals, meanwhile, are just extra-extra incentivized). You can give Adderall to a kid and watch him sit down at his desk and do his work, but by no means is that kid ""calm."" That kid is intensely focused. He is more ""awake"" than he has ever been. He has more energy than he has ever had, but he's narrowly focusing all that energy on a single task.   


The way people talk about untreated ADHD, you would think it's just like being hypomanic, but it's nothing like that. It's much more akin to clinical depression, and the meds do the same exact thing to them as to neurotypicals. The only difference is that with ADHD, you're bringing a broken reward system to equilibrium by flooding it, whereas if you have a normal reward system, it's just extra flooded.",913

The correct answer is that you should always swap.

On the surface, it seems like a 50/50 shot, and most people who are presented this problem will say that your choice doesn't matter. However, it doesn't take into account your previous action. Unlike the gambler's fallacy, in the Monty Hall Problem your first choice influences the results of the second. When you picked your first door there were three cases- in two of them you picked the goat, and in one you picked the money. Odds are 2 in 3 that you selected the goat. You still have that door when the other goat is eliminated, meaning that the odds are now 2 in 3 that the remaining door is the money, when accounting for the previous cases.",2164

The boss would buy the rights to pursue the offenders (IIRC the process) and then sue the bar owners per tv that the fight was shown on, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. 

The part that felt unethical was that he didn’t do this full time, as his main gig.

17j9bn7,k70zfuq,"For a very long time the Roman empire was able to acquire silk through trade over 'the silk road' to China, but never able to unlock the secrets of producing it domestically themselves. Until 552AD, when two monks preaching in India then travelled to China, where they witnessed the guarded methods of using the live silk worm to spin the famous thread. Knowing the importance of what they'd learned, the monks returned to Constantinople to report directly to the emperor Justinian. He personally met the monks, heard all the details of what they'd seen, then asked them to return to China and find a way of smuggling these worms back to the empire. They agreed, and prepared for the 2 year ~6,500km (4,000mi) trek back to China on foot, hoof and wheel. Once back in China they acquired either eggs or young larvae, since the adults are too delicate for transport, and tucked them into hollowed bamboo canes for the long journey straight back home. Once the monks made it back to Constantinople (modern Istanbul, Turkey), domestic silk production slowly ramped up and the need for long journeys along the 'silk road' ramped down. Over time, this allowed the same type of silk monopoly which China had enjoyed through the prior centuries to now be established in the Mediterranean, becoming one of the bedrocks of the Byzantine economy for the next 700 years.

It's crazy to think about these two guys. 1500 years before you or I were born, making their second multi-year, 6,500km trek back from China, smuggling two bamboo canes full of bugs which would fuel the economy of one of the world's largest civilizations for the next 700 years. I wonder if they knew and understood these possibilities when they went to scoop the worms from their baskets in China...Imagine the anxiety trying to keep them hidden and alive the whole way back!",462
17j9bn7,k7063oh,"John “Mad Jack” Churchill was a British officer in World War Two. He’s famous because he brought along a Scottish claymore, bagpipes, and a bow and got the “only confirmed longbow kill of the Second World War.” One time he was with part of his commando unit and a shell exploded and injured everyone but him, so he played a Scottish Jacobite song on his bagpipes until the Germans captured him and sent him to a prison camp. He promptly escaped via a tunnel he dug and almost got to the ocean before he got recaptured. By then, it was April 1945, and the German military was falling apart, so they let him go soon pretty quickly. He’s famous for the quote “any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed”.

TLDR he led a commando battalion, used a sword and a longbow in the 1940s, was captured while playing bagpipes as his buddies fell around him, and then escaped by digging a tunnel out of a prison camp.
