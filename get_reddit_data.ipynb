Seven year-old Carl  was sitting quietly with the correct answer (5050) while the rest of the class was just starting, so the surprised teacher asked him how he came up with the solution. He replied that he added 1 and 100 and got 101. Then he added 2 and 99, and got 101, 3 plus 98 = 101, and so on.

If those 3 months go by and still no movement is made, then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency. Something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president.

There should be no vacations, time off, or excuses with the exception of terminal illness. If a member of congress fails to show up, they would effectively be removed from congress, and if the sitting President or Vice President is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget.\n",
      " I support a law that ends shutdowns by continuing funding at previous levels if no new budget is passed\n",
      " I like the idea, but I don't think it would do a whole lot. First, there would be some Constitutional issues with regards to the 27th Amendment.

      " I'd be more in favor of holding an impromptu election like other countries do. If a Congress can't work together to keep the govt open at a minimum, why not revote and whoever the public decides is the problem gets thrown out?\n",
      " Here's the thing: I only think it would work if you eliminated income from all sources, i.e. investments and outside revenue streams.  Basically you'd have to put a freeze on the bank accounts of the politicians during a shutdown, and you'd never have one again.  At least half of our members of Congress have such wherewithal that their congressional salary is meaningless to them.\n",
      " The cost of voting to shutdown the government should be the calling of new elections.\n",

There is a random man in the background telling Floyd just to get in the car and he can't win. Floyd can be heard saying he knows and he's done. This implies that Floyd may have resisted or attempted to escape, but was still restrained in the handcuffs. Floyd can be heard multiple times saying he can't breathe. The cell phone video shows the officer kneeling on top of Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes, with around four of those minutes with Floyd being unconscious.\n",

Why did the other officer not assist the primary officer with restraining Floyd so they could get him in the patrol unit quicker? Why did the primary officer continue to restrain Floyd by his neck after Floyd became unresponsive? Why can the officer be heard at some point asking Floyd if he is still a tough guy? I can only come up with one answer to all of these questions, and that was the primary officer, Chauvin, wanted to prove to Floyd that Floyd was not such a tough guy. I see an officer assaulting another human being, going beyond taking control of a suspect, using force as punishment and ultimately causing the death of another human being. I see a second officer who stood and watched and did nothing, despite knowing that what the first officer was doing was a violation of law and policy. I see officers who were trying to get back at Floyd for running his mouth and resisting an arrest by using force they KNEW could result in death or serious bodily injury in a situation which did not justify using deadly force.\n",

I hope this officer, and any officer who allowed this to happen, is tried and convicted.

He had all the time in the world to think about what he was doing. He had multiple people there telling him to stop. And none of his fellow officers intervened.

You treat combative in-custodies once they’re secured as human beings. Nothing should be personal.  Once they’ve been subdued and you are safe as an officer, you stand him up, pat him down and understand that your arrestee is at a low point in his life.  Give him some dignity and you’ll generally get his respect.  It works 90+% of the time.  \n",

I had tears streaming down my face watching the video of George Floyd. We swore to protect our communities and that’s what we set out to do everyday.

      " Obligatory not a doctor, but spouse of a doctor. I thought I might have a ganglion cyst in my wrist because I could feel something inside that was causing pain when I moved my wrist so I scheduled an appt with a orthopedic surgeon/hand specialist. I had my husband come along (interventional radiologist) in case there were questions I wouldn’t have thought of asking or something I needed more explanation on later. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ortho/hand surgeon was friendly and used layman terms with me but technical jargon with my husband. It was funny to hear the switch between “your wrist bones/tendons” and “blah blah anterior blah blah medial blah” whatever he said to my husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point they did an ultrasound on my wrist to determine if it might be a cyst or if I should get a more detailed MRI, and the surgeon asked my husband if he wanted to take over the ultrasound (since my husband trained in diagnostic radiology as well) and he totally did! Weird to have your husband moving the ultrasound wand and pointing to random blobs of static. They both agreed it was a cyst, even though it looked like a whole lot of static and nothingness to me. So it was interesting to see my husband defer to the surgeon for his specialty and vice versa!\n",

      "Edit:\n",
      "Just remembered that time we took our cat in for an X-ray because she was developing arthritis and we weren’t sure how severe it was or if her bones were deteriorating. My husband actually took her X-ray in and had an attending in radiology read it and they were both convinced our cat had bone spurs or little bone growths around her spine near her hip. He was about 80% convinced that our cat’s spine was absolutely wrecked. The vet wasn’t worried and said that cat bones just look like that and it wasn’t hurting her and was nothing to worry about. He ended up doing some research on feline anatomy to make sure our (very knowledgeable) vet wasn’t just talking out of her ass. She wasn’t.\n",

      " These are things that can be learned independently by simply doing them. Taxes are damned near idiot proof in most cases because they are designed to be. Washing clothes, follow the instruction manual. Cooking? Watch YouTube, follow a recipe. What these all have in common is that you need a solid grasp on numeracy and literacy. These are things that must be explicitly taught. These are the core skills that underpin almost everything. People who complain about not being taught how to do their taxes tend to have shitty numeracy skills. People who struggle to fill out a form tend to have shitty literacy. Can't read instructions? Literacy issue. You can make education as practical as possible but the fact is: many don't want to learn, until it's too late. I say this as a teacher: we really do a lot to make education as relevant to real-world needs as possible but there is not getting around the fact that a person must learn to be fluent in both reading and writing, as well as be able to think mathematically to cope in the \"real world\". The rest of what we do is for the purpose of teaching you how to learn effectively, how to think in different ways, how to adapt to unfamiliar challenges and how to deal with abstract ideas. We don't teach the model of the atom because you need to know where the elections go. We teach you so that you can learn how to grasp concepts that are not directly observable, make logical conclusions from them and apply abstract ideas to real-world phenomena. The actual topics are just vehicles for these skills\n",

The empire was in its last legs, due in large part to the the fall during the fourth crusade in 1204. It had a lot of internal and external problems. For example, Konstantinos Palaiologos was never officially coronated, due to religious infighting. The Ottoman empire had already conquered all of the farmland around, and was right to go for the kill at the time that it did. It conquered a great strategic and cultural landmark. The Hagia Sophia had already become a mosque in 29th May 1453, 2.30 in the afternoon. It's a pity for my heritage, but at that time I think it was inevitable.\n",

Without those Who fled the distraction of the city we might never have had the return of Greek and Roman knowledge held by the Byzantines as the true heirs of Rome. In reality there was not much holding the remnants of the Byzantine Empire alive once the farmland in Anatolia had been conquered realistically the city would only be able to survive for so long. In addition the Ottomans raising taxes on trade would block off connections to China and India which would help to encourage the Spaniards and Portuguese as well as the Dutch later on in their maritime shipping interests.

      " During college that was located away from major cities, the woods were all around us. That being said, there was a highly rated trail, the Loyalsock Trail, which was about an hour drive from the university. I invited a friend to come with me as he had never been on an extended backpacking trip. A 50+ mile trail that we intended to backpack over the four day weekend. I am an Eagle Scout who has spent countless hours in the woods and went on backpacking trips consistently throughout my college experience. As many have said before me, you get used to the minor “spooky” things happening; Coyote howls, raccoons in the middle of the night, even the occasional unknown noise. The scariest thing to find in the woods, however, are people.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were about 20 miles into the trail and, being Pennsylvania where the underbrush and trees line the trails pretty densely, I always walk about 100 meters off of the trail to reduce the chances of me disturbing people/people disturbing me (especially in the early morning when I choose to sleep in). Following that same strategy, my friend and I go out of our way to be in this amazing spot a good ways off of the trail where it would even be difficult to see our flashlights from the trail. This spot was on a peninsula where a creek met a river, meaning there was only one way into our camp and only one way out. We start a fire, cook our food, and drink some (but not enough to get either of us drunk). We put the fire out about midnight and head in to our individual tents. All is quite. It is the fall semester, so leaves are on the ground, the moon is brightly shining through the bare trees, and the air is cool. The only noise is the occasional time when I would hear my friend turn over in his sleep. Then, I hear the voices...\n",

      "The voices sounded very close for being on the trail 100+ meters away. I check my watch; 3am. Who hikes at 3am? We are 20 miles in. I slowly get out of my sleeping bag, slowly unzip my tent, only to see my friend peaking out of his tent in the exact same fashion. He quickly moves his finger over his mouth in an exaggerated “hush” signal, then used the same hand to frantically motion towards the way of the trail. Then we see them. Four adults, three men and one woman, walking directly towards our camp. No lights illuminating their path; They are walking silently at this point. Only one of them has a backpack; An impossibility for the long hike they were 1/3 of the way through. Being a long trip, you bring wood cutting supplies to chop branches into smaller branches to burn; For me, this was a survival knife. Grabbing the knife, believing it is my only way of defending myself, I am more disheveled than I ever have been, especially knowing that a knife is barely defense at all. These people walk into our site, sit down by our extinguished fire pit, and just sit there for what felt like an eternity. \n",

      "My friend speaks up and asks what they are doing in our campsite. Without answering the question, they ask if we have any food. Having packed as lightly as possible for the long trip. We had only a few extra Mountain House, MRE-style meals. I grab one out of my bag and toss it to one of the men. In rapid succession, I ask why they aren’t using a light, if they need help finding the trail, and why they are hiking so late. They respond with the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) “We don’t use lights”\n",
      "2) “We know where the trail is”\n",
      "3) “It is better to hike late at night”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unnerved at this point, my friend asks them to leave. They respond by asking if we want to light the fire and hangout for a bit. No we do not. They grab their bag, get up, and leave without speaking another word. We watch them leave and take shifts making sure that they didn’t come back. Needless to say, we both got very little sleep that night. When the sun rose the next morning, we finally got “real” sleep. By the afternoon, when we woke up, it all felt like a weird dream of sorts. The only evidence was a fuzzy cap that they must have dropped that I have to this day.\n",

I worked night shift so this meant I would sleep in the sleeping quarters during day time with either just me or a handfull of other crew members where usually there'd be 20 to 30 of us in there. It wasn't so bad. Actually I really liked because it's a lot more peaceful sleelimg during the day. You don't hear anybody else snoring or someones footsteps because they have to piss or something like that. All you can hear is the light creak of the walls and the floors of the ship and all you can feel is the sway of it on the ocean. A bit haunting and creepy of you really think about it but I like it. \n",

      "All that ended when there was a short period of time was literally only 2 of us in there or at least that's what I thought. I started hearing light taps across the room. At  first they were light taps. Then it would get a bit faster. Sometimes it'll get a bit louder. I'd ignore it if it wasn't so utterly annoying. I look at where the other guys is sleeping and he seems to be fast asleep accompanied by his light snoring. 2nd day, there it goes again. I tried to follow the sound but for some reason it bounced around the room like an echo. Eventually it comes to an abrupt halt. So I try to sleep it off. During work at night I tried to ask my mate about it but he said he was too tired to even notice. I guess I'm alone on this pursuit. \n",

This time I go from one empty rack to the next until finally it was loud as fuck, tapping in progress. My heart was thumping like a jackhammer. I pulled the curtain to the side. There laid the biggest dude I've ever seen on the ship holding his dick mid stroke. You have no idea the speech I prepared for this guy, in my head, for keeping me up for several days but at that exact moment I had no idea what to say. Of course I gave out a small yalp which didn't help the situation. I never thought I'd be locking eyes with another dude while he's gripping his dong when I began this honorable pursuit. \n",
      "\n",
      "With the current situation I mustered my best attempt at displaying my annoyance. It somehow came out as an apology followed by \"I keep hearing tapping noises\". He hadn't said anything yet but at that exact moment, I realized that his elbow that which belong to the fapping arm is resting right on the wall probably banging on it over and over and over. I didn't wait for a reply. I nodded my head, kind of rolled my eye and walked away. It will never be easy trying to avoid a big guy like him everyday  in the same sleeping quarters.\n",
      " Used to be a supervisor for a janitorial company and a couple times a week I had to go to a middle school and clean their hallway floors and gymnasium with a zamboni type vehicle that mopped and scrubbed the floor. When I was there I had the whole school to myself. Used to get finished quickly and go to the library and read while eating my dinner. Well, one morning after being there, I get a call from school security and they want me to come in. When I get there I see a police car too. Uh oh, I think. They ask me a few questions like “did you notice anything out of the ordinary or strange while you were here last night?” No, I hadn’t (usually have headphones in). Security then shows me camera footage of someone breaking into one of the classrooms WHILE I WAS RIDING THE ZAMBONI not far away. I was there for another two hours. Nothing was stolen. But the worst part was they didn’t have footage of the person leaving, they didn’t go out the way they came in, and police had to sweep the entire school. Never did find out what happened with that one.\n",
      " On our drill ship that was built in China, we noticed on the drawings there was a room. We went to look at it and couldnt find an entrance but the spacing was obvious there was an extra room. It might not sound so creepy unless youve been in these shipyards where two things are known to happen: stowaways, although i doubt it in this case, but also hundreds of workers at any given time following orders blindly. So we confirmed that the room had all six sides, yet not a single weld on the outside. There is only one way this couldve happened and im sure youre starting to get it now. They must have welded from the inside for this room and then realized they had no way out upon completion if the gasses didnt kill them first. \n",

This was in the backwoods, so to deter trespassing and vandalism the county had built an 8 foot tall fence around the entire 5 acre parcel and put barbed wire on top of the fence.

Both were perfectly fine ways of grieving, however it is expected that ones grief is more than the other.

So you know you're getting some bad news. It turns out it was kidney cancer. They removed my right kidney, fortunately no other treatments were needed, and I'm living the best life right now. If the tumor in my kidney didn't started to bleed I would have found out much much later, probably to late.\n",

So I got to keep my job, but what was supposed to take me all day literally took me about 20-30 minutes first thing in the morning. So they started assigning me real tasks, and even offered to keep me on to eventually become an underwriter, too.

      " In 1991 I took a ferry from Brindisi Italy to Corfu Greece. A guy I met in line assumed I didn't speak English, and he was telling his friend that they needed to smoke all of their weed because they heard that the border agents in Greece were strict. We became fast friends. I had booze too. I was going to sleep in the open air on the deck, but a French Canadian girl with a mustache kept trying to crawl into my sleeping bag with me and do the nasty (I'm a guy btw). It finally came to a point where I knew my only chance to get some sleep and get away was to rent a room, so I went and paid the extra money for a room to Corfu, they were going to wake me up when we reached port. I wake up and the pursers are knocking on my door. So I let them in and say \"Corfu?\". No. they say. I was a bit annoyed. Why the fuck are you waking me up if we're not at my port? I try to convey that, and then they say \"No Corfu\". Huh? \"Corfu gone\". Whaaaaat? I find myself being escorted up to some obviously policey kind of office with the pursers looking angry at me, but I finally get to somebody that speaks English and start ripping them for not fucking waking me up! \n",

      "I guess they didn't like my attitude because I was booted off on mainland Greece with no way to get to fucking Corfu. With a raging hangover. And I'm about to shit my pants. I start asking around the port how I can get to Corfu and where I can find a bathroom. Some random Greek guy took pity on me and helped me out, and suddenly realized that a rust bucket that was just about to leave was heading there! I rush over and pay, and it's not a tourist boat, it's the boat the locals take to work on the island. I make a beeline for the head, and a dude stops me. No using the bathroom while in port. I have to wait until they get past the breakwall. \n",

You know that sense of relief you get when you're finally at a bathroom after more than an hour of clenching? It was palpable. I get into the bathroom and I'm hit with a wall of hot stench. No worries. I can do the old curl the upper lip trick to close my nostrils. I'm on a mission. I open the stall door and... No toilet. This is Greece. It's a hole in the shit covered floor with two spots for your feet.\n",

Now since I had just begun the squat my eyes happened to be perfectly aligned with the hole. And there I see a black liquid mass working it's way up from the deep like an angry creature from the Earth's core. Those thoughts from the back of my brain come rushing forward into the spotlight! Now I'm strongly suspecting that the Greeks, well at least most of them, don't have prehensile anuses! There is a perfectly valid reason that there is shit all over the floor and I was witnessing it!

They found the baby unresponsive after his nap, air-flighted him to the hospital, and were able to get his heart started again, but he had no brain activity from oxygen deprivation, so he wouldn’t be able to breathe on his own and would die if unhooked from all his machines. The baby’s organs were all perfectly healthy, so staff approached the mother about organ donation to save another baby’s life.

      "For context: When a baby is in intensive care, it’s hard to hold them, because all the tubes and wires are in the way. In most modern bereaved parent of infants situations, the school of thought is that it is less traumatic to the parents if the child is allowed to be with them for some time after he or she is unhooked from machines. Most parents hold their baby while he or she dies, etc...In some progressive countries, they even have refrigerated cribs, so that parents can take their baby home for a few days and grieve in their own way. This is way different than the past, when doctors thought taking a dead child away ASAP, before the parents could see it, was best to reduce trauma (spoiler alert, its not).\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyhow, these folks knew their baby was going to die, but in order for organ donation to occur, he needed to be unhooked in the OR, because they transplant the beating heart of infant directly into the other baby.

I can help the world be a better place! I was full of cynicism and hatred for the way the world worked I wanted to do anything to change it.

Everything he says and does is beloved and adored by them, and any policy, action, or statement opposing him is taken as a personal insult by his followers and causes them to label you as “anti-American”, “socialist”, or “terrorist”, to name a few. I’ve had to watch as Fox News has rotted my parents’ brains feeding them blatant propaganda 24/7. Nothing I can say, do, or show them will cause them to think differently at this point. Every one of his supporters is blind to each and every way he has undermined our democracy and I simply can’t take having this man embarrass the United States for another damn day. He literally speaks incoherent jibberish every time he opens his mouth, but somehow not a damn one of his supporters sees a single problem and they hail him as a genius, their god emperor.\n",

The best part was these different items were often placed in completely separate parts of the store and it was the job of the dressing room to return the unpurchased items to the correct section so the employees could put them back on the shelves. Well, these employees fucking sucked and I didn’t know if they were a part of my section or not so I’d spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to find where they go before realizing “wait this isn’t even my section I’ve checked literally every rack” so I’d put it back on the sorting rack and move to the next item.

      "Very faintly I heard someone crying. I approached and found out that it came from a backyard. If I wanted to see who it was, I had to climb a high fence. When I walked into the backyard I was fucking horrified, there was a crying little kid, like 3 years old on a leash, tied to a pole. I didn't dare to approach, because that child was leaking valck stuff from the nose.\n",

If I’m having a dream before I wake up and I go back to sleep, I can usually continue the dream. Last night I had a dream that I was in some kind of resort/jurassic park-like area. I went back to sleep this morning and managed to get into a relationship with a pretty hot dude who was working at the resort.\n",
      " I dreamt that I was part of some Eastern European resistance movement who had to speak in code and hide out in abandoned manors in the forest to plan our attacks against some fascist regime. We enlisted the pope to help us, but when we went to meet him he has double crossed us because the regime we were fighting somehow knew the pope was gay and was going to tell everyone. I woke up then, not knowing if my resistance group was executed, or if we escaped somehow.\n",

Then my immediate thought would be \"WHO SHOULD I PRETEND SLEEP WITH?\" and the excitement over that possibility woke me up every damn time.\n",
      " Was exploring a jungle with a group of (i assume) friends. We ended up discovering some kind of temple, but it was dark so we decided to set up camp. I was charged with gathering drywood and leafs for the fire. While machet-ing my way through vines, I heard my name being screamed by one of the group members in a terrified way, repeatedly.

Along the way, we somehow were exposed to radioactive waste that gave us all super powers or other mutations. I remember so vividly being able to use my mind to move objects with ease, and I threw donuts at my brother, whose skin had turned as hard as stone. This one girl on the cruise that we all universally hated (for reasons I can't remember) received a really random and useless mutation - she grew a really fat lizard tail, like a leopard gecko who has eaten a lot lol. She was crying about how ugly she was now and all we could do was laugh. Then I woke up.\n",

It’s a curse at times, but this morning I had an amber alert at 3:30 am, and my dream went from being okay to my friends getting incinerated by a nuke. I was the only one that survived, but by the time I was about to leave the bunker to see the devastation, I woke up turning off the alert.\n",
